@{ CRT (Crt Replacement Tool)
  Portable BP compatible CRT unit for GPC with many extensions

  This unit is aware of terminal types. This means programs using
  this unit will work whether run locally or while being logged in
  remotely from a system with a completely different terminal type
  (as long as the appropriate terminfo entry is present on the
  system where the program is run).

  NOTES:

  - The CRT unit needs the ncurses and panel libraries which should
    be available for almost any system. For Dos systems, where
    ncurses is not available, it is configured to use the PDCurses
    and its panel library instead. On Unix systems with X11, it can
    also use PDCurses (xcurses) and xpanel to produce X11 programs.
    The advantage is that the program won't need an xterm with a
    valid terminfo entry, the output may look a little nicer and
    function keys work better than in an xterm, but the disadvantage
    is that it will only run under X. The ncurses and PDCurses
    libraries (including panel and xpanel, resp.) can be found in
    http://www.gnu-pascal.de/libs/
    (Note that ncurses is already installed on many Unix systems.)
    For ncurses, version 5.0 or newer is strongly recommended
    because older versions contain a bug that severely affects CRT
    programs.

    When an X11 version under Unix is wanted, give @samp{-DX11} when
    compiling crt.pas and crtc.c (or when compiling crt.pas or a
    program that uses CRT with @samp{--automake}). On pre-X11R6 systems,
    give @samp{-DNOX11R6} additionally. You might also have to give the
    path to the X11 libraries with @samp{-L}, e.g. @samp{-L /usr/X11/lib}.

  - A few features cannot be implemented in a portable way and are
    only available on some systems:

    Notes:

    1) If you define NO_CRT_DUMMY_SOUND while compiling CRT, you
       will get linking errors when your program tries to use
       Sound/NoSound on a platform where it's not supported (which
       is useful to detect at compile time if playing sound is a
       major task of your program). Otherwise, Sound/NoSound will
       simply do nothing (which is usually acceptable if the program
       uses these routines just for an occasional beep).

    2) Changing to monochrome modes works on all platforms. Changing
       the screen size only works on those indicated. However, even
       on the platforms not supported, the program will react to
       screen size changes by external means (e.g. changing the
       window size with the mouse if running in a GUI window or
       resizing a console or virtual terminal).

    3) Probably also on other processors, but I've had no chance to
       test this yet.

    4) Only on a local console with access permissions to the
       corresponding virtual console memory device or using the
       @samp{crtscreen} utility (see crtscreen.c in the demos directory).

    5) Only if supported by an external command (e.g., in xterms and
       on local Linux consoles). The command to be called can be
       defined in the environment variable @samp{RESIZETERM} (where the
       variables @samp{columns} and @samp{lines} in the command are set to the
       size wanted). If not set, the code will try @samp{resize -s} in an
       xterm and otherwise @samp{SVGATextMode} and @samp{setfont}. For this to
       work, these utilities need to be present in the PATH or
       @samp{/usr/sbin} or @samp{/usr/local/sbin}. Furthermore, SVGATextMode
       and setfont require root permissions, either to the
       executable of the program compiled with CRT or to resizecons
       (called by setfont) or SVGATextMode. To allow the latter, do
       "chmod u+s `which resizecons`" and/or
       "chmod u+s `which SVGATextMode`", as root once, but only if
       you really want each user to be allowed to change the text
       mode.

    6) Only on local consoles.

    7) Some terminals only. Most xterms etc. support it as well as
       other terminals that support an "alternate screen" in the
       smcup/rmcup terminal capabilities.

    8) But the user can resize the window.

    9) Only with PDCurses, not with ncurses. Changing the number of
       screen *columns* doesn't work in a full-screen session.

  - When CRT is initialized (automatically or explicitly; see the
    comments for CRTInit), the screen is cleared, and at the end of
    the program, the cursor is placed at the bottom of the screen
    (curses behaviour).

  - All the other things (including most details like color and
    function key constants) are compatible with BP's CRT unit, and
    there are many extensions that BP's unit does not have.

  - When the screen size is changed by an external event (e.g.,
    resizing an xterm or changing the screen size from another VC
    under Linux), the virtual "function key" kbScreenSizeChanged is
    returned. Applications can use the virtual key to resize their
    windows. kbScreenSizeChanged will not be returned if the screen
    size change was initiated by the program itself (by using
    TextMode or SetScreenSize). Note that TextMode sets the current
    panel to the full screen size, sets the text attribute to the
    default and clears the window (BP compatibility), while
    SetScreenSize does not.

  - After the screen size has been changed, whether by using
    TextMode, SetScreenSize or by an external event, ScreenSize will
    return the new screen size. The current window and all panels
    will have been adjusted to the new screen size. This means, if
    their right or lower ends are outside the new screen size, the
    windows are moved to the left and/or top as far as necessary. If
    this is not enough, i.e., if they are wider/higher than the new
    screen size, they are shrinked to the total screen width/height.
    When the screen size is enlarged, window sizes are not changed,
    with one exception: Windows that extend through the whole screen
    width/height are enlarged to the whole new screen width/height
    (in particular, full-screen windows remain full-screen). This
    behaviour might not be optimal for all purposes, but you can
    always resize your windows in your application after the screen
    size change.

  - (ncurses only) The environment variable @samp{ESCDELAY} specifies the
    number of milliseconds allowed between an @samp{Esc} character and
    the rest of an escape sequence (default 1000). Setting it to a
    value too small can cause problems with programs not recognizing
    escape sequences such as function keys, especially over slow
    network connections. Setting it to a value too large can delay
    the recognition of an @samp{ESC} key press notably. On local Linux
    consoles, e.g., 10 seems to be a good value.

  - When trying to write portable programs, don't rely on exactly
    the same look of your output and the availability of all the key
    combinations. Some kinds of terminals support only some of the
    display attributes and special characters, and usually not all
    of the keys declared are really available. Therefore, it's safer
    to provide the same function on different key combinations and
    to not use the more exotic ones.

  - CRT supports an additional modifier key (if present), called
    @samp{Extra}. On DJGPP, it's the <Scroll Lock> key, under X11 it's
    the modifier #4, and on a local Linux console, it's the @samp{CtrlL}
    modifier (value 64) which is unused on many keytabs and can be
    mapped to any key(s), e.g. to those keys on new keyboards with
    these ugly symbols waiting to be replaced by penguins (keycodes
    125 and 127) by inserting the following two lines into your
    /etc/default.keytab and reloading the keytab with @samp{loadkeys}
    (you usually have to do this as root):

    keycode 125 = CtrlL
    keycode 127 = CtrlL

@{ =================== Extensions over BP's CRT =================== @}

@{ Initializes the CRT unit. Should be called before using any of
  CRT's routines.

  Note: For BP compatibility, CRT is initizalized automatically when
  (almost) any of its routines are used for the first time. In this
  case, some defaults are set to match BP more closely. In
  particular, the PC charset (see SetPCCharSet) is enabled then
  (disabled otherwise), and the update level (see SetCRTUpdate) is
  set to UpdateRegularly (UpdateWaitInput otherwise). This feature
  is meant for BP compatibility *only*. Don't rely on it when
  writing a new program. Use CRTInit then, and set the defaults to
  the values you want explicitly.

  SetCRTUpdate is one of those few routines which will not cause CRT
  to be initialized immediately, and a value set with it will
  survive both automatic and explicit initialization, so you can use
  it to set the update level without caring which way CRT will be
  initialized. (This does not apply to SetPCCharSet. Since it works
  on a per-panel basis, it has to initialize CRT first, so there is
  a panel to start with.)

  If you terminate the program before calling CRTInit or any routine
  that causes automatic initialization, curses will never be
  initialized, so e.g., the screen won't be cleared. This can be
  useful, e.g., to check the command line arguments (or anything
  else) and if there's a problem, write an error and abort. Just be
  sure to write the error to StdErr, not Output (because Output will
  be assigned to CRT, and therefore writing to Output will cause CRT
  to be initialized, and because errors belong to StdErr, anyway),
  and to call @samp{RestoreTerminal (True)} before (just to be sure, in
  case some code -- perhaps added later, or hidden in the
  initialization of some unit -- does initialize CRT). @}
procedure CRTInit; asmname 'crt_init';

@{ Changes the input and output file and the terminal description CRT
  uses. Only effective with ncurses, and only if called before CRT

@{ If called, causes CRT to save the previous screen contents if
  possible (see the comments at the beginning of the unit), and

  RestoreTerminal (False), they're saved again, and at the end of
  the program, they're restored. Should be called before
  initializing CRT (using CRTInit or automatically), otherwise the
  previous screen contents may already have been overwritten. Note
  that on some terminals (e.g., xterms and similar), this is the
