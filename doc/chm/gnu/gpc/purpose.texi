The purpose of the GNU Pascal project is to produce a Pascal
compiler (called GNU Pascal or GPC) which

@itemize @bullet
@item combines the clarity of Pascal with powerful tools suitable
for real-life programming,

@item supports both the Pascal standard and the Extended Pascal
standard as defined by ISO, ANSI and IEEE (ISO 7185:1990, ISO/IEC
10206:1991, ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989),

@item supports other Pascal standards (UCSD Pascal, Borland Pascal,
parts of Borland Delphi and Pascal-SC) in so far as this serves the
goal of clarity and usability,

@item may be distributed under GNU license conditions, and

@item can generate code for and run on any computer for which the
GNU C compiler can generate code and run on.
@end itemize

Pascal was originally designed for teaching. GNU Pascal provides a
smooth way to proceed to challenging programming tasks without
learning a completely different language.

The current release implements Standard Pascal (ISO 7185, levels 0
and 1), a large subset of Extended Pascal (ISO 10206, aiming for
full compliance), is highly compatible to Borland Pascal (version
7.0) with some Delphi extensions, and provides a lot of useful GNU
extensions.
