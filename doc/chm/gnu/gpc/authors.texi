We thank everybody who supports us by reporting bugs, contributing
knowledge and good ideas, donating development tools, and giving us
the opportunity to test GPC on a large variety of systems. We are
particularly indebted (in alphabetical order, individuals first) to

GNU Pascal is based on GNU CC by Richard Stallman.  Several people have
contributed to GNU CC:

@c -- JJ 13jul96: should we keep all these ?
@c I already zapped a number of irrelevant ones.
@c
@c Keep them, but with a note that we are talking about GNU C now.
@c (I zapped another one who contributed to the C++ front-end.)
@c (Or: ask the FSF.) -- PG, 2. Aug 1996

@item
The idea of using RTL and some of the optimization ideas came from

and Christopher Fraser.  See ``Register Allocation and Exhaustive
Peephole Optimization'', Software Practice and Experience 14 (9),
Sept. 1984, 857-866.
