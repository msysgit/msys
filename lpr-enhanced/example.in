#
# sample printer configuration for MSYS/Cygwin "lp" and "lpr" commands ...
# contributed by Keith Marshall <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>
#
# the format of this file closely follows that of BSD printcap ...
# but only a subset of the BSD standard is currently implemented, viz. ...
#
#   -  each printer configuration record occupies ONE LOGICAL line
#      in the configuration file
#   -  a LOGICAL line may be extended over multiple PHYSICAL lines,
#      by placing "\" as the last character on all but the last
#      PHYSICAL line
#   -  comment lines may be introduced, by placing "#" as the first
#      non-blank character on the line
#   -  each printer configuration record comprises a list of colon (":")
#      separated configuration data fields
#   -  the LOGICAL printer name occupies the FIRST field of the
#      configuration record; there MUST be NO leading colon
#   -  alternate printer names are supported, by specifing the name
#      field as a "|" separated list of alternate names; common usage
#      specifies:
#          primary-name|alt-name-1|...|alt-name-n|description
#   -  additional configuration data fields, following the printer
#      name field, specify configuration parameters with ONE
#      "parameter=value" pair per field; parameters currently
#      supported by "lp" and "lpr" are restricted to:
#          :lp=output stream path of local printer:
#          :rp=share name of remote printer:
#          :rm=machine name for remote printer host:
#          :lf=full path name of log file for spooling error messages:
#          :sd=path to directory where spool files are written:
#          :ld=start of job leader string to initialise printer:
#          :if=inline filter for file formatting and spooling:
#          :of=output filter for job dispatch:
#          :pw#output page width as characters per line:
#          :pl#output page length as lines per page:
#          :ff=form feed string; default=\014:
#          :fo: ; boolean to force form feed at start of job
#          :fq: ; boolean to force form feed at end of job
#          :sf: ; boolean to suppress form feed between output files
#          :tr=end of job trailer string to reset printer:
#   -  any arbitrary parameter, which is not listed above, may be
#      specified, but will be silently ignored
#
# in addition to the standard printcap implementation, as described above,
# the system default printer is specified by including the special name
# "<default>" as an alternate name for any ONE configured printer;
# additionally, the implementation supports the following non-standard
# printcap attributes:
#
#   -  :bg: boolean, set by default; use :bg@: to spool in foreground
#
#   -  :lm#margin columns:
#           number of character width columns used for left margin
#
#   -  :mi=margin indicator: 
#           flag char to pass "lm" to "if", as in "$if -$mi$lm ..."
#           defaults to "i"; (WARNING: set :mi=o: if :if=/bin/pr ...:)
#
# CAUTION:
#   string arguments to "ff", "ld" and "tr" parameters are represented in a
#   form suitable for interpretation by "echo -en"; they CANNOT contain
#   embedded ":" or "|" characters; however these may be represented using
#   the octal escape notation, as "\072" and "\174" respectively
