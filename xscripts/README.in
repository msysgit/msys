The `x86\-mingw32\-build' script will build a cross compiler suite,
hosted on GNU/Linux or UNIX,
and targetting the Win32 platform.

.LP
To build a MinGW cross GCC,
using `x86\-mingw32\-build',
you MUST have NATIVE versions of the following tools
installed on the machine where you will perform the build:\(em
.TP 1)
A C compiler.
.TP 2)
A `lex' compatible lexical parser generator,
such as `lex' itself,
or a free alternative such as `flex'.
.TP 3)
A `yacc' compatible grammar parser generator,
preferrably a `yacc' replacement such as `GNU\~bison' or `byacc'.
.TP 4)
An `m4' macro processor,
if it is required by either of the above.
.LP
The cross compiler configuration is defined in the user modifiable file,
`x86\-mingw32\-build.sh.conf'.
You are advised to review this file,
to ensure that the default configuration is suited to your requirements;
use the `assume' directive to supply initial default settings,
and the `option' directive to extend specified lists of configuration options.
.LP
To invoke the build script:\(em
.TP 1)
Unpack the tarball,
into a directory of your choice;
it will create a subdirectory called `x86\-mingw32\-build\-<version>'.
.TP 2)
`cd' to this `x86\-mingw32\-build\-<version>' directory.
.TP 3)
Start the build,
by executing the command:\(en
.QP 4
sh x86\-mingw32\-build.sh [\-\-options ...] [target\-spec]
.LP
Your choice of `target\-spec' defines the class of processor,
and the operating system,
for which your cross compiler will generate code;
it also determines how your cross compiler will eventually be invoked;
e.g.\~if you choose a canonical host triplet,
such as `i586\-pc\-mingw32' then you would invoke `gcc',
say to compile `foo.c',
as:\(en
.QP 4
i586\-pc\-mingw32\-gcc \-c foo.c
.LP
generating object code suitable for deployment on an Intel Pentium class host,
running a 32\-bit MS\-Windows operating system.
.LP
Do note that you cannot make an arbitrary choice for `target-spec';
it MUST represent,
either directly or by inference,
a valid canonical host triplet of the form `CPU\-MAKER\-OSTYPE'.
The minimum requirement is that you specify the `OSTYPE',
and,
since you are building a MinGW compiler tool chain for the Win32 platform,
this MUST be `mingw32'.
Typically,
you would choose a full canonical host triplet,
such as in the example above,
in which the CPU is `i586',
the MAKER is `pc',
(indicating any generic PC of non\-specific manufacture),
and the OSTYPE is the mandatory `mingw32';
alternatively,
you may prefer to use an abbreviated couplet such as `i586\-mingw32'.
If you don't specify any `target\-spec',
it defaults to the couplet `i386\-mingw32',
resulting in a C compiler invoked as:\(en
.QP 4
i386\-mingw32\-gcc \-c foo.c
.LP
and similarly for the remainder of the cross tool chain,
by prefixing `i386\-mingw32\-' to the regular name of each tool;
such a compiler,
and its associated tool chain,
will generate code to run under 32\-bit MS\-Windows,
(the host OS for the `mingw32' OSTYPE),
on all generations of the Intel x86 CPU from i386 onwards.
.LP
Additionally,
there are a number of options available,
to modify the behaviour of `x86\-mingw32\-build';
to see a list,
try:\(en
.QP 4
sh x86\-mingw32\-build.sh \-\-help
.LP
By default,
`x86\-mingw32\-build.sh' runs interactively;
this gives you an opportunity to adjust many of the default parameters,
which have been defined in `x86\-mingw32\-build.sh.conf'.
If you prefer to skip the interactive dialogue,
and simply accept all of the default parameter settings,
you may invoke:\(en
.QP 4
sh x86\-mingw32\-build.sh \-\-unattended [target\-spec]
.LP
`x86\-mingw32\-build' will build the cross compiler from source packages,
with versions as specified in `x86\-mingw32\-build.sh.conf';
if the specified versions are not already present in a directory of your
choice on the local host,
then `x86\-mingw32\-build' will invoke `wget',
to download those package versions.
If run interactively,
you will be given the opportunity to override the packace versions
specified in `x86\-mingw32\-build.sh.conf',
substituting any version which is already present
in your local package directory;
if run unattended,
you may use the `\-\-no\-download' option to prevent downloads;
with this option,
`x86\-mingw32\-build' will expect to find the specified version in the
local download directory,
or,
if the `\-\-use\-latest\-versions' option is specified,
it will automatically substitute the most recent version
which is already present in that directory.
.LP
If you discover any bug in `x86\-mingw32\-build',
please report it by following the procedure described at:\(en
