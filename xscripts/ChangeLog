	Add support for new MinGW.org package naming conventions.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh (MINGWRT): New shell variable; define it
	as the requisite package base name for `mingw-runtime' or `mingwrt',
	which is determined by new `tarname' function; use it to resolve all
	subsequent references to the `mingw-runtime' package.
	(COMPONENT) [mingw-runtime]: Make it match `$MINGWRT'; build it for
	whatever package base name that may be specified thereby.
	(LEAN_BUILD) [isyes]: Purge all plausible `$MINGWRT' aliases.
	(TARGET_OS): New shell variable; define it.
	(TARGET): Use it.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.functions (tarname): New function; it

	(gcc_srctag, binutils_srctag, mingwrt_srctag, w32api_srctag): New
	optionally defined shell variables; define as required; use them in
	all package name references, with default value of "src".

	analogue of `$MINGWRT'.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.dialogue (tarname): Use as appropriate.
	(gcc_srctag, binutils_srctag, mingwrt_srctag, w32api_srctag): New
	optionally defined shell variables; define and use them in same manner
	as they are used in `x86-mingw32-build.sh.batch'.
	(mingwrt): New shell variable; define and use it in same manner as it
	is used in `x86-mingw32-build.sh.batch'.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.conf (BUILD_COMPONENTS): Reschedule...
	(headers): ...this as first component for installation, ahead of...
	(binutils): ...this, which now needs the headers to be pre-installed
	in the designated `sysroot' path, before it is built.

2009-02-19  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fix MinGW-Bug[2031691]: Dry run may break subsequent build.

	* x86-mingw32-build.sh.getopts [--dry-run] (BUILD_PLATFORM):
	Pre-define; avoid invocation of `config.guess' at point of use.
