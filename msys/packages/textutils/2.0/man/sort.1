.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.
.TP
+POS1 [-POS2]
start a key at POS1, end it *before* POS2 (obsolescent)
.IP
field numbers and character offsets are numbered
starting with zero (contrast with the \fB\-k\fR option)
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
ignore leading blanks in sort fields or keys
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
check if given files already sorted, do not sort
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
consider only [a-zA-Z0-9 ] characters in keys
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
fold lower case to upper case characters in keys
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
compare according to general numerical value, imply \fB\-b\fR
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
consider only [\040-\0176] characters in keys
.TP
\fB\-k\fR POS1[,POS2]
start a key at POS1, end it *at* POS2
.IP
field numbers and character offsets are numbered
starting with one (contrast with zero-based +POS form)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR
merge already sorted files, do not sort
.TP
\fB\-M\fR
compare (unknown) < `JAN' < ... < `DEC', imply \fB\-b\fR
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
compare according to string numerical value, imply \fB\-b\fR
.TP
\fB\-o\fR FILE
write result on FILE instead of standard output
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
reverse the result of comparisons
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
stabilize sort by disabling last resort comparison
.TP
\fB\-t\fR SEP
use SEParator instead of non- to whitespace transition
.TP
\fB\-T\fR DIRECTORY
use DIRECTORY for temporary files, not $TMPDIR or /tmp
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
with \fB\-c\fR, check for strict ordering;
with \fB\-m\fR, only output the first of an equal sequence
.TP
\fB\-z\fR
end lines with 0 byte, not newline, for find \fB\-print0\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
POS is F[.C][OPTS], where F is the field number and C the character position
in the field, both counted from one with \fB\-k\fR, from zero with the obsolescent
form.  OPTS is made up of one or more of Mbdfinr; this effectively disables
global \fB\-Mbdfinr\fR settings for that key.  If no key is given, use the entire
line as the key.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
