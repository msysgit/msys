Introduction
************

   This manual is incomplete: No attempt is made to explain basic
concepts in a way suitable for novices.  Thus, if you are interested,
please get involved in improving this manual.  The entire GNU community
will benefit.

   The GNU text utilities are mostly compatible with the POSIX.2
standard.

   Please report bugs to <bug-textutils@gnu.org>.  Remember to include
the version number, machine architecture, input files, and any other
information needed to reproduce the bug: your input, what you expected,
what you got, and why it is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but please
include a description of the problem as well, since this is sometimes
difficult to infer. *Note Bugs: (gcc)Bugs.

   This manual was originally derived from the Unix man pages in the
distribution, which were written by David MacKenzie and updated by Jim
Meyering.  What you are reading now is the authoritative documentation
for these utilities;  the man pages are no longer being maintained.
The original `fmt' man page was written by Ross Paterson.  Franc,ois
Pinard did the initial conversion to Texinfo format.  Karl Berry did
the indexing, some reorganization, and editing of the results.  Richard
Stallman contributed his usual invaluable insights to the overall
process.

Common options
**************

   Certain options are available in all these programs.  Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here.  (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept)
these options.)

   A few of these programs take arbitrary strings as arguments.  In
those cases, `--help' and `--version' are taken as these options only
if there is one and exactly one command line argument.

`--help'
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

`--version'
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.

Output of entire files
**********************

   These commands read and write entire files, possibly transforming
them in some way.

* Menu:

* cat invocation::              Concatenate and write files.
* tac invocation::              Concatenate and write files in reverse.
* nl invocation::               Number lines and write files.
* od invocation::               Write files in octal or other formats.


File: textutils.info,  Node: cat invocation,  Next: tac invocation,  Up: Output of entire files

`cat': Concatenate and write files
==================================

   `cat' copies each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output.  Synopsis:

     cat [OPTION] [FILE]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-A'
`--show-all'
     Equivalent to `-vET'.

`-B'
`--binary'
     On MS-DOS and MS-Windows only, read and write the files in binary
     mode.  By default, `cat' on MS-DOS/MS-Windows uses binary mode
     only when standard output is redirected to a file or a pipe; this
     option overrides that.  Binary file I/O is used so that the files
     retain their format (Unix text as opposed to DOS text and binary),
     because `cat' is frequently used as a file-copying program.  Some
     options (see below) cause `cat' read and write files in text mode
     because then the original file contents aren't important (e.g.,
     when lines are numbered by `cat', or when line endings should be
     marked).  This is so these options work as DOS/Windows users would
     expect; for example, DOS-style text files have their lines end with
     the CR-LF pair of characters which won't be processed as an empty
     line by `-b' unless the file is read in text mode.

`-b'
`--number-nonblank'
     Number all nonblank output lines, starting with 1.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write files in
     text mode.

`-e'
     Equivalent to `-vE'.

`-E'
`--show-ends'
     Display a `$' after the end of each line.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write files in
     text mode.

`-n'
`--number'
     Number all output lines, starting with 1.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write files in
     text mode.

`-s'
`--squeeze-blank'
     Replace multiple adjacent blank lines with a single blank line.  On
     MS-DOS and MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read and write
     files in text mode.

`-t'
     Equivalent to `-vT'.

`-T'
`--show-tabs'
     Display TAB characters as `^I'.

`-u'
     Ignored; for Unix compatibility.

`-v'
`--show-nonprinting'
     Display control characters except for LFD and TAB using `^'
     notation and precede characters that have the high bit set with
     `M-'.  On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, this option causes `cat' to read
     files and standard input in DOS binary mode, so the CR characters
     at the end of each line are also visible.


File: textutils.info,  Node: tac invocation,  Next: nl invocation,  Prev: cat invocation,  Up: Output of entire files

`tac': Concatenate and write files in reverse
=============================================

   `tac' copies each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, reversing the records (lines by
default) in each separately.  Synopsis:

     tac [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   "Records" are separated by instances of a string (newline by
default).  By default, this separator string is attached to the end of
the record that it follows in the file.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--before'
     The separator is attached to the beginning of the record that it
     precedes in the file.

`-r'
`--regex'
     Treat the separator string as a regular expression.  Users of `tac'
     on MS-DOS/MS-Windows should note that, since `tac' reads files in
     binary mode, each line of a text file might end with a CR/LF pair
     instead of the Unix-style LF.

`-s SEPARATOR'
`--separator=SEPARATOR'
     Use SEPARATOR as the record separator, instead of newline.


File: textutils.info,  Node: nl invocation,  Next: od invocation,  Prev: tac invocation,  Up: Output of entire files

`nl': Number lines and write files
==================================

   `nl' writes each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, with line numbers added to some
or all of the lines.  Synopsis:

     nl [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `nl' decomposes its input into (logical) pages; by default, the line
number is reset to 1 at the top of each logical page.  `nl' treats all
of the input files as a single document; it does not reset line numbers
or logical pages between files.

   A logical page consists of three sections: header, body, and footer.
Any of the sections can be empty.  Each can be numbered in a different
style from the others.

   The beginnings of the sections of logical pages are indicated in the
input file by a line containing exactly one of these delimiter strings:

`\:\:\:'
     start of header;

`\:\:'
     start of body;

`\:'
     start of footer.

   The two characters from which these strings are made can be changed
from `\' and `:' via options (see below), but the pattern and length of
each string cannot be changed.

   A section delimiter is replaced by an empty line on output.  Any text
that comes before the first section delimiter string in the input file
is considered to be part of a body section, so `nl' treats a file that
contains no section delimiters as a single body section.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b STYLE'
`--body-numbering=STYLE'
     Select the numbering style for lines in the body section of each
     logical page.  When a line is not numbered, the current line number
     is not incremented, but the line number separator character is
     still prepended to the line.  The styles are:

    `a'
          number all lines,

    `t'
          number only nonempty lines (default for body),

    `n'
          do not number lines (default for header and footer),

    `pREGEXP'
          number only lines that contain a match for REGEXP.

`-d CD'
`--section-delimiter=CD'
     Set the section delimiter characters to CD; default is `\:'. If
     only C is given, the second remains `:'.  (Remember to protect `\'
     or other metacharacters from shell expansion with quotes or extra
     backslashes.)

`-f STYLE'
`--footer-numbering=STYLE'
     Analogous to `--body-numbering'.

`-h STYLE'
`--header-numbering=STYLE'
     Analogous to `--body-numbering'.

`-i NUMBER'
`--page-increment=NUMBER'
     Increment line numbers by NUMBER (default 1).

`-l NUMBER'
`--join-blank-lines=NUMBER'
     Consider NUMBER (default 1) consecutive empty lines to be one
     logical line for numbering, and only number the last one.  Where
     fewer than NUMBER consecutive empty lines occur, do not number
     them.  An empty line is one that contains no characters, not even
     spaces or tabs.

`-n FORMAT'
`--number-format=FORMAT'
     Select the line numbering format (default is `rn'):

    `ln'
          left justified, no leading zeros;

    `rn'
          right justified, no leading zeros;

    `rz'
          right justified, leading zeros.

`-p'
`--no-renumber'
     Do not reset the line number at the start of a logical page.

`-s STRING'
`--number-separator=STRING'
     Separate the line number from the text line in the output with
     STRING (default is the TAB character).

`-v NUMBER'
`--starting-line-number=NUMBER'
     Set the initial line number on each logical page to NUMBER
     (default 1).

`-w NUMBER'
`--number-width=NUMBER'
     Use NUMBER characters for line numbers (default 6).


File: textutils.info,  Node: od invocation,  Prev: nl invocation,  Up: Output of entire files

`od': Write files in octal or other formats
===========================================

   `od' writes an unambiguous representation of each FILE (`-' means
standard input), or standard input if none are given.  Synopsis:

     od [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     od -C [FILE] [[+]OFFSET [[+]LABEL]]

   Each line of output consists of the offset in the input, followed by
groups of data from the file. By default, `od' prints the offset in
octal, and each group of file data is two bytes of input printed as a
single octal number.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-A RADIX'
`--address-radix=RADIX'
     Select the base in which file offsets are printed.  RADIX can be
     one of the following:

    `d'
          decimal;

    `o'
          octal;

    `x'
          hexadecimal;

    `n'
          none (do not print offsets).

     The default is octal.

`-j BYTES'
`--skip-bytes=BYTES'
     Skip BYTES input bytes before formatting and writing.  If BYTES
     begins with `0x' or `0X', it is interpreted in hexadecimal;
     otherwise, if it begins with `0', in octal; otherwise, in decimal.
     Appending `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by
     1048576.

`-N BYTES'
`--read-bytes=BYTES'
     Output at most BYTES bytes of the input.  Prefixes and suffixes on
     `bytes' are interpreted as for the `-j' option.

`-s [N]'
`--strings[=N]'
     Instead of the normal output, output only "string constants": at
     least N (3 by default) consecutive ASCII graphic characters,
     followed by a null (zero) byte.

`-t TYPE'
`--format=TYPE'
     Select the format in which to output the file data.  TYPE is a
     string of one or more of the below type indicator characters.  If
     you include more than one type indicator character in a single TYPE
     string, or use this option more than once, `od' writes one copy of
     each output line using each of the data types that you specified,
     in the order that you specified.

     Adding a trailing "z" to any type specification appends a display
     of the ASCII character representation of the printable characters
     to the output line generated by the type specification.

    `a'
          named character,

    `c'
          ASCII character or backslash escape,

    `d'
          signed decimal,

    `f'
          floating point,

    `o'
          octal,

    `u'
          unsigned decimal,

    `x'
          hexadecimal.

     The type `a' outputs things like `sp' for space, `nl' for newline,
     and `nul' for a null (zero) byte.  Type `c' outputs ` ', `\n', and
     `\0', respectively.

     Except for types `a' and `c', you can specify the number of bytes
     to use in interpreting each number in the given data type by
     following the type indicator character with a decimal integer.
     Alternately, you can specify the size of one of the C compiler's
     built-in data types by following the type indicator character with
     one of the following characters.  For integers (`d', `o', `u',
     `x'):

    `C'
          char,

    `S'
          short,

    `I'
          int,

    `L'
          long.

     For floating point (`f'):

    F
          float,

    D
          double,

    L
          long double.

`-v'
`--output-duplicates'
     Output consecutive lines that are identical.  By default, when two
     or more consecutive output lines would be identical, `od' outputs
     only the first line, and puts just an asterisk on the following
     line to indicate the elision.

`-w[N]'
`--width[=N]'
     Dump `n' input bytes per output line.  This must be a multiple of
     the least common multiple of the sizes associated with the
     specified output types.  If N is omitted, the default is 32.  If
     this option is not given at all, the default is 16.

   The next several options map the old, pre-POSIX format specification
options to the corresponding POSIX format specs.  GNU `od' accepts any
combination of old- and new-style options.  Format specification
options accumulate.

`-a'
     Output as named characters.  Equivalent to `-ta'.

`-b'
     Output as octal bytes.  Equivalent to `-toC'.

`-c'
     Output as ASCII characters or backslash escapes.  Equivalent to
     `-tc'.

`-d'
     Output as unsigned decimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-tu2'.

`-f'
     Output as floats.  Equivalent to `-tfF'.

`-h'
     Output as hexadecimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-tx2'.

`-i'
     Output as decimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-td2'.

`-l'
     Output as decimal longs.  Equivalent to `-td4'.

`-o'
     Output as octal shorts.  Equivalent to `-to2'.

`-x'
     Output as hexadecimal shorts.  Equivalent to `-tx2'.

`-C'
`--traditional'
     Recognize the pre-POSIX non-option arguments that traditional `od'
     accepted.  The following syntax:

          od --traditional [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b] [[+]LABEL[.][b]]]

     can be used to specify at most one file and optional arguments
     specifying an offset and a pseudo-start address, LABEL.  By
     default, OFFSET is interpreted as an octal number specifying how
     many input bytes to skip before formatting and writing.  The
     optional trailing decimal point forces the interpretation of
     OFFSET as a decimal number.  If no decimal is specified and the
     offset begins with `0x' or `0X' it is interpreted as a hexadecimal
     number.  If there is a trailing `b', the number of bytes skipped
     will be OFFSET multiplied by 512.  The LABEL argument is
     interpreted just like OFFSET, but it specifies an initial
     pseudo-address.  The pseudo-addresses are displayed in parentheses
     following any normal address.

File: textutils.info,  Node: fmt invocation,  Next: pr invocation,  Up: Formatting file contents

`fmt': Reformat paragraph text
==============================

   `fmt' fills and joins lines to produce output lines of (at most) a
given number of characters (75 by default).  Synopsis:

     fmt [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `fmt' reads from the specified FILE arguments (or standard input if
none are given), and writes to standard output.

   By default, blank lines, spaces between words, and indentation are
preserved in the output; successive input lines with different
indentation are not joined; tabs are expanded on input and introduced on
output.

   `fmt' prefers breaking lines at the end of a sentence, and tries to
avoid line breaks after the first word of a sentence or before the last
word of a sentence.  A "sentence break" is defined as either the end of
a paragraph or a word ending in any of `.?!', followed by two spaces or
end of line, ignoring any intervening parentheses or quotes.  Like TeX,
`fmt' reads entire "paragraphs" before choosing line breaks; the
algorithm is a variant of that in "Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines"
(Donald E. Knuth and Michael F. Plass, `Software--Practice and
Experience', 11 (1981), 1119-1184).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c'
`--crown-margin'
     "Crown margin" mode: preserve the indentation of the first two
     lines within a paragraph, and align the left margin of each
     subsequent line with that of the second line.

`-t'
`--tagged-paragraph'
     "Tagged paragraph" mode: like crown margin mode, except that if
     indentation of the first line of a paragraph is the same as the
     indentation of the second, the first line is treated as a one-line
     paragraph.

`-s'
`--split-only'
     Split lines only.  Do not join short lines to form longer ones.
     This prevents sample lines of code, and other such "formatted"
     text from being unduly combined.

`-u'
`--uniform-spacing'
     Uniform spacing.  Reduce spacing between words to one space, and
     spacing between sentences to two spaces.

`-WIDTH'
`-w WIDTH'
`--width=WIDTH'
     Fill output lines up to WIDTH characters (default 75).  `fmt'
     initially tries to make lines about 7% shorter than this, to give
     it room to balance line lengths.

`-p PREFIX'
`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Only lines beginning with PREFIX (possibly preceded by whitespace)
     are subject to formatting. The prefix and any preceding whitespace
     are stripped for the formatting and then re-attached to each
     formatted output line.  One use is to format certain kinds of
     program comments, while leaving the code unchanged.

`pr': Paginate or columnate files for printing
==============================================

   `pr' writes each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard input
if none are given, to standard output, paginating and optionally
outputting in multicolumn format; optionally merges all FILEs, printing
all in parallel, one per column.  Synopsis:

     pr [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, a 5-line header is printed at each page: two blank lines;
a line with the date, the filename, and the page count; and two more
blank lines.  A footer of five blank lines is also printed.  With the
`-F' option, a 3-line header is printed: the leading two blank lines are
omitted; no footer is used.  The default PAGE_LENGTH in both cases is 66
lines.  The default number of text lines changes from 56 (without `-F')
to 63 (with `-F').  The text line of the header takes up the full
PAGE_WIDTH in the form `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM string Page nnnn'.  String is
a centered header string.

   Form feeds in the input cause page breaks in the output.  Multiple
form feeds produce empty pages.

   Columns are of equal width, separated by an optional string (default
is `space').  For multicolumn output, lines will always be truncated to
PAGE_WIDTH (default 72), unless you use the `-J' option.  For single
column output no line truncation occurs by default.  Use `-W' option to
truncate lines in that case.

   Including version 1.22i:

   Some small LETTER OPTIONS (`-s', `-w') has been redefined with the
object of a better POSIX compliance.  The output of some further cases
has been adapted to other UNIXes.  A violation of downward
compatibility has to be accepted.

   Some NEW CAPITAL LETTER options (`-J', `-S', `-W') has been
introduced to turn off unexpected interferences of small letter
options.  The `-N' option and the second argument LAST_PAGE of
`+FIRST_PAGE' offer more flexibility.  The detailed handling of form
feeds set in the input files requires `-T' option.

   Capital letter options dominate small letter ones.

   Some of the option-arguments (compare `-s', `-S', `-e', `-i', `-n')
cannot be specified as separate arguments from the preceding option
letter (already stated in the POSIX specification).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`+FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE]'
`--pages=FIRST_PAGE[:LAST_PAGE]'
     Begin printing with page FIRST_PAGE and stop with LAST_PAGE.
     Missing `:LAST_PAGE' implies end of file.  While estimating the
     number of skipped pages each form feed in the input file results
     in a new page.  Page counting with and without `+FIRST_PAGE' is
     identical.  By default, counting starts with the first page of
     input file (not first page printed).  Line numbering may be
     altered by `-N' option.

`-COLUMN'
`--columns=COLUMN'
     With each single FILE, produce COLUMN columns of output (default
     is 1) and print columns down, unless `-a' is used.  The column
     width is automatically decreased as COLUMN increases; unless you
     use the `-W/-w' option to increase PAGE_WIDTH as well.  This
     option might well cause some lines to be truncated.  The number of
     lines in the columns on each page are balanced.  The options `-e'
     and `-i' are on for multiple text-column output.  Together with
     `-J' option column alignment and line truncation is turned off.
     Lines of full length are joined in a free field format and `-S'
     option may set field separators.  `-COLUMN' may not be used with
     `-m' option.

`-a'
`--across'
     With each single FILE, print columns across rather than down.  The
     `-COLUMN' option must be given with COLUMN greater than one.  If a
     line is too long to fit in a column, it is truncated.

`-c'
`--show-control-chars'
     Print control characters using hat notation (e.g., `^G'); print
     other unprintable characters in octal backslash notation.  By
     default, unprintable characters are not changed.

`-d'
`--double-space'
     Double space the output.

`-e[IN-TABCHAR[IN-TABWIDTH]]'
`--expand-tabs[=IN-TABCHAR[IN-TABWIDTH]]'
     Expand TABs to spaces on input.  Optional argument IN-TABCHAR is
     the input tab character (default is the TAB character).  Second
     optional argument IN-TABWIDTH is the input tab character's width
     (default is 8).

`-f'
`-F'
`--form-feed'
     Use a form feed instead of newlines to separate output pages.  The
     default page length of 66 lines is not altered.  But the number of
     lines of text per page changes from default 56 to 63 lines.

`-h HEADER'
`--header=HEADER'
     Replace the filename in the header with the centered string HEADER.
     Left-hand-side truncation (marked by a `*') may occur if the total
     header line `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM HEADER Page nnnn' becomes larger than
     PAGE_WIDTH.  `-h ""' prints a blank line header.  Don't use `-h""'.
     A space between the `-h' option and the argument is always
     indispensable.

`-i[OUT-TABCHAR[OUT-TABWIDTH]]'
`--output-tabs[=OUT-TABCHAR[OUT-TABWIDTH]]'
     Replace spaces with TABs on output.  Optional argument OUT-TABCHAR
     is the output tab character (default is the TAB character).
     Second optional argument OUT-TABWIDTH is the output tab
     character's width (default is 8).

`-J'
`--join-lines'
     Merge lines of full length.  Used together with the column options
     `-COLUMN', `-a -COLUMN' or `-m'.  Turns off `-W/-w' line
     truncation; no column alignment used; may be used with
     `-S[STRING]'.  `-J' has been introduced (together with `-W' and
     `-S') to disentangle the old (POSIX compliant) options `-w' and
     `-s' along with the three column options.

`-l PAGE_LENGTH'
`--length=PAGE_LENGTH'
     Set the page length to PAGE_LENGTH (default 66) lines, including
     the lines of the header [and the footer].  If PAGE_LENGTH is less
     than or equal 10 (and <= 3 with `-F'), the header and footer are
     omitted, and all form feeds set in input files are eliminated, as
     if the `-T' option had been given.

`-m'
`--merge'
     Merge and print all FILEs in parallel, one in each column.  If a
     line is too long to fit in a column, it is truncated, unless `-J'
     option is used.  `-S[STRING]' may be used.  Empty pages in some
     FILEs (form feeds set) produce empty columns, still marked by
     STRING.  The result is a continuous line numbering and column
     marking throughout the whole merged file.  Completely empty merged
     pages show no separators or line numbers.  The default header
     becomes `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM <blanks> Page nnnn'; may be used with
     `-h HEADER' to fill up the middle blank part.

`-n[NUMBER-SEPARATOR[DIGITS]]'
`--number-lines[=NUMBER-SEPARATOR[DIGITS]]'
     Provide DIGITS digit line numbering (default for DIGITS is 5).
     With multicolumn output the number occupies the first DIGITS
     column positions of each text column or only each line of `-m'
     output.  With single column output the number precedes each line
     just as `-m' does.  Default counting of the line numbers starts
     with 1st line of the input file (not the 1st line printed, compare
     the `--page' option and `-N' option).  Optional argument
     NUMBER-SEPARATOR is the character appended to the line number to
     separate it from the text followed.  The default separator is the
     TAB character.  In a strict sense a TAB is always printed with
     single column output only.  The TAB-width varies with the
     TAB-position, e.g. with the left MARGIN specified by `-o' option.
     With multicolumn output priority is given to `equal width of
     output columns' (a POSIX specification).  The TAB-width is fixed
     to the value of the 1st column and does not change with different
     values of left MARGIN.  That means a fixed number of spaces is
     always printed in the place of the NUMBER-SEPARATOR TAB.  The
     tabification depends upon the output position.

`-N LINE_NUMBER'
`--first-line-number=LINE_NUMBER'
     Start line counting with the number LINE_NUMBER at first line of
     first page printed (in most cases not the first line of the input
     file).

`-o MARGIN'
`--indent=MARGIN'
     Indent each line with a margin MARGIN spaces wide (default is
     zero).  The total page width is the size of the margin plus the
     PAGE_WIDTH set with the `-W/-w' option.  A limited overflow may
     occur with numbered single column output (compare `-n' option).

`-r'
`--no-file-warnings'
     Do not print a warning message when an argument FILE cannot be
     opened.  (The exit status will still be nonzero, however.)

`-s[CHAR]'
`--separator[=CHAR]'
     Separate columns by a single character CHAR.  Default for CHAR is
     the TAB character without `-w' and `no character' with `-w'.
     Without `-s' default separator `space' is set.  `-s[char]' turns
     off line truncation of all three column options (`-COLUMN'|`-a
     -COLUMN'|`-m') except `-w' is set.  That is a POSIX compliant
     formulation.

`-S[STRING]'
`--sep-string[=STRING]'
     Use STRING to separate output columns.  The `-S' option doesn't
     affect the `-W/-w' option, unlike the `-s' option which does.  It
     does not affect line truncation or column alignment.  Without
     `-S', and with `-J', `pr' uses the default output separator, TAB.
     Without `-S' or `-J', `pr' uses a `space' (same as `-S" "').
     Using `-S' with no STRING is equivalent to `-S""'.  Note that for
     some of `pr''s options the single-letter option character must be
     followed immediately by any corresponding argument; there may not
     be any intervening white space.  `-S/-s' is one of them.  Don't
     use `-S "STRING"'.  POSIX requires this.

`-t'
`--omit-header'
     Do not print the usual header [and footer] on each page, and do
     not fill out the bottom of pages (with blank lines or a form
     feed).  No page structure is produced, but form feeds set in the
     input files are retained.  The predefined pagination is not
     changed.  `-t' or `-T' may be useful together with other options;
     e.g.: `-t -e4', expand TAB characters in the input file to 4
     spaces but don't make any other changes.  Use of `-t' overrides
     `-h'.

`-T'
`--omit-pagination'
     Do not print header [and footer].  In addition eliminate all form
     feeds set in the input files.

`-v'
`--show-nonprinting'
     Print unprintable characters in octal backslash notation.

`-w PAGE_WIDTH'
`--width=PAGE_WIDTH'
     Set page width to PAGE_WIDTH characters for multiple text-column
     output only (default for PAGE_WIDTH is 72).  `-s[CHAR]' turns off
     the default page width and any line truncation and column
     alignment.  Lines of full length are merged, regardless of the
     column options set.  No PAGE_WIDTH setting is possible with single
     column output.  A POSIX compliant formulation.

`-W PAGE_WIDTH'
`--page_width=PAGE_WIDTH'
     Set the page width to PAGE_WIDTH characters.  That's valid with and
     without a column option.  Text lines are truncated, unless `-J' is
     used.  Together with one of the three column options (`-COLUMN',
     `-a -COLUMN' or `-m') column alignment is always used.  The
     separator options `-S' or `-s' don't affect the `-W' option.
     Default is 72 characters.  Without `-W PAGE_WIDTH' and without any
     of the column options NO line truncation is used (defined to keep
     downward compatibility and to meet most frequent tasks).  That's
     equivalent to `-W 72 -J'.  With and without `-W PAGE_WIDTH' the
     header line is always truncated to avoid line overflow.

`fold': Wrap input lines to fit in specified width
==================================================

   `fold' writes each FILE (`-' means standard input), or standard
input if none are given, to standard output, breaking long lines.
Synopsis:

     fold [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, `fold' breaks lines wider than 80 columns.  The output
is split into as many lines as necessary.

   `fold' counts screen columns by default; thus, a tab may count more
than one column, backspace decreases the column count, and carriage
return sets the column to zero.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--bytes'
     Count bytes rather than columns, so that tabs, backspaces, and
     carriage returns are each counted as taking up one column, just
     like other characters.

`-s'
`--spaces'
     Break at word boundaries: the line is broken after the last blank
     before the maximum line length.  If the line contains no such
     blanks, the line is broken at the maximum line length as usual.

`-w WIDTH'
`--width=WIDTH'
     Use a maximum line length of WIDTH columns instead of 80.

File: textutils.info,  Node: head invocation,  Next: tail invocation,  Up: Output of parts of files

`head': Output the first part of files
======================================

   `head' prints the first part (10 lines by default) of each FILE; it
reads from standard input if no files are given or when given a FILE of
`-'.  Synopses:

     head [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     head -NUMBER [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If more than one FILE is specified, `head' prints a one-line header
consisting of
     ==> FILE NAME <==

before the output for each FILE.

   `head' accepts two option formats: the new one, in which numbers are
arguments to the options (`-q -n 1'), and the old one, in which the
number precedes any option letters (`-1q').

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-COUNTOPTIONS'
     This option is only recognized if it is specified first.  COUNT is
     a decimal number optionally followed by a size letter (`b', `k',
     `m') as in `-c', or `l' to mean count by lines, or other option
     letters (`cqv').

`-c BYTES'
`--bytes=BYTES'
     Print the first BYTES bytes, instead of initial lines.  Appending
     `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by 1048576.

`-n N'
`--lines=N'
     Output the first N lines.

`-q'
`--quiet'
`--silent'
     Never print file name headers.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Always print file name headers.


File: textutils.info,  Node: tail invocation,  Next: split invocation,  Prev: head invocation,  Up: Output of parts of files

`tail': Output the last part of files
=====================================

   `tail' prints the last part (10 lines by default) of each FILE; it
reads from standard input if no files are given or when given a FILE of
`-'.  Synopses:

     tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     tail -NUMBER [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     tail +NUMBER [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If more than one FILE is specified, `tail' prints a one-line header
consisting of
     ==> FILE NAME <==

before the output for each FILE.

   GNU `tail' can output any amount of data (some other versions of
`tail' cannot).  It also has no `-r' option (print in reverse), since
reversing a file is really a different job from printing the end of a
file; BSD `tail' (which is the one with `-r') can only reverse files
that are at most as large as its buffer, which is typically 32k.  A
more reliable and versatile way to reverse files is the GNU `tac'
command.

   `tail' accepts two option formats: the new one, in which numbers are
arguments to the options (`-n 1'), and the old one, in which the number
precedes any option letters (`-1' or `+1').

   If any option-argument is a number N starting with a `+', `tail'
begins printing with the Nth item from the start of each file, instead
of from the end.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-COUNT'
`+COUNT'
     This option is only recognized if it is specified first.  COUNT is
     a decimal number optionally followed by a size letter (`b', `k',
     `m') as in `-c', or `l' to mean count by lines, or other option
     letters (`cfqv').

`-c BYTES'
`--bytes=BYTES'
     Output the last BYTES bytes, instead of final lines.  Appending
     `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by 1048576.

`-f'
`--follow[=HOW]'
     Loop forever trying to read more characters at the end of the file,
     presumably because the file is growing.  This option is ignored
     when reading from a pipe.  If more than one file is given, `tail'
     prints a header whenever it gets output from a different file, to
     indicate which file that output is from.

     There are two ways to specify how you'd like to track files with
     this option, but that difference is noticeable only when a
     followed file is removed or renamed.  If you'd like to continue to
     track the end of a growing file even after it has been unlinked,
     use `--follow=descriptor'.  This is the default behavior, but it
     is not useful if you're tracking a log file that may be rotated
     (removed or renamed, then reopened).  In that case, use
     `--follow=name' to track the named file by reopening it
     periodically to see if it has been removed and recreated by some
     other program.

     No matter which method you use, if the tracked file is determined
     to have shrunk, `tail' prints a message saying the file has been
     truncated and resumes tracking the end of the file from the
     newly-determined endpoint.

     When a file is removed, `tail''s behavior depends on whether it is
     following the name or the descriptor.  When following by name,
     tail can detect that a file has been removed and gives a message
     to that effect, and if `--retry' has been specified it will
     continue checking periodically to see if the file reappears.  When
     following a descriptor, tail does not detect that the file has
     been unlinked or renamed and issues no message;  even though the
     file may no longer be accessible via its original name, it may
     still be growing.

     The option values `descriptor' and `name' may be specified only
     with the long form of the option, not with `-f'.

`--retry'
     This option is meaningful only when following by name.  Without
     this option, when tail encounters a file that doesn't exist or is
     otherwise inaccessible, it reports that fact and never checks it
     again.

`--sleep-interval=N'
     Change the number of seconds to wait between iterations (the
     default is 1).  During one iteration, every specified file is
     checked to see if it has changed size.

`--pid=PID'
     When following by name or by descriptor, you may specify the
     process ID, PID, of the sole writer of all FILE arguments.  Then,
     shortly after that process terminates, tail will also terminate.
     This will work properly only if the writer and the tailing process
     are running on the same machine.  For example, to save the output
     of a build in a file and to watch the file grow, if you invoke
     `make' and `tail' like this then the tail process will stop when
     your build completes.  Without this option, you would have had to
     kill the `tail -f' process yourself.
          $ make >& makerr & tail --pid=$! -f makerr
     If you specify a PID that is not in use or that does not correspond
     to the process that is writing to the tailed files, then `tail'
     may terminate long before any FILEs stop growing or it may not
     terminate until long after the real writer has terminated.

`--max-consecutive-size-changes=N'
     This option is meaningful only when following by name.  Use it to
     control how long `tail' follows the descriptor of a file that
     continues growing at a rapid pace even after it is deleted or
     renamed.  After detecting N consecutive size changes for a file,
     `open'/`fstat' the file to determine if that file name is still
     associated with the same device/inode-number pair as before.  See
     the output of `tail --help' for the default value.

`--max-unchanged-stats=N'
     When tailing a file by name, if there have been this many
     consecutive iterations for which the size has remained the same,
     then `open'/`fstat' the file to determine if that file name is
     still associated with the same device/inode-number pair as before.
     When following a log file that is rotated this is approximately the
     number of seconds between when tail prints the last pre-rotation
     lines and when it prints the lines that have accumulated in the
     new log file.  See the output of `tail --help' for the default
     value.  This option is meaningful only when following by name.

`-n N'
`--lines=N'
     Output the last N lines.

`-q'
`-quiet'
`--silent'
     Never print file name headers.

`-v'
`--verbose'
     Always print file name headers.


File: textutils.info,  Node: split invocation,  Next: csplit invocation,  Prev: tail invocation,  Up: Output of parts of files

`split': Split a file into fixed-size pieces
============================================

   `split' creates output files containing consecutive sections of
INPUT (standard input if none is given or INPUT is `-').  Synopsis:

     split [OPTION] [INPUT [PREFIX]]

   By default, `split' puts 1000 lines of INPUT (or whatever is left
over for the last section), into each output file.

   The output files' names consist of PREFIX (`x' by default) followed
by a group of letters `aa', `ab', and so on, such that concatenating
the output files in sorted order by file name produces the original
input file.  (If more than 676 output files are required, `split' uses
`zaa', `zab', etc.)

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-LINES'
`-l LINES'
`--lines=LINES'
     Put LINES lines of INPUT into each output file.

`-b BYTES'
`--bytes=BYTES'
     Put the first BYTES bytes of INPUT into each output file.
     Appending `b' multiplies BYTES by 512, `k' by 1024, and `m' by
     1048576.

`-C BYTES'
`--line-bytes=BYTES'
     Put into each output file as many complete lines of INPUT as
     possible without exceeding BYTES bytes.  For lines longer than
     BYTES bytes, put BYTES bytes into each output file until less than
     BYTES bytes of the line are left, then continue normally.  BYTES
     has the same format as for the `--bytes' option.

`--verbose'
     Write a diagnostic to standard error just before each output file
     is opened.


File: textutils.info,  Node: csplit invocation,  Prev: split invocation,  Up: Output of parts of files

`csplit': Split a file into context-determined pieces
=====================================================

   `csplit' creates zero or more output files containing sections of
INPUT (standard input if INPUT is `-').  Synopsis:

     csplit [OPTION]... INPUT PATTERN...

   The contents of the output files are determined by the PATTERN
arguments, as detailed below.  An error occurs if a PATTERN argument
refers to a nonexistent line of the input file (e.g., if no remaining
line matches a given regular expression).  After every PATTERN has been
matched, any remaining input is copied into one last output file.

   By default, `csplit' prints the number of bytes written to each
output file after it has been created.

   The types of pattern arguments are:

`N'
     Create an output file containing the input up to but not including
     line N (a positive integer).  If followed by a repeat count, also
     create an output file containing the next LINE lines of the input
     file once for each repeat.

`/REGEXP/[OFFSET]'
     Create an output file containing the current line up to (but not
     including) the next line of the input file that contains a match
     for REGEXP.  The optional OFFSET is a `+' or `-' followed by a
     positive integer.  If it is given, the input up to the matching
     line plus or minus OFFSET is put into the output file, and the
     line after that begins the next section of input.

`%REGEXP%[OFFSET]'
     Like the previous type, except that it does not create an output
     file, so that section of the input file is effectively ignored.

`{REPEAT-COUNT}'
     Repeat the previous pattern REPEAT-COUNT additional times.
     REPEAT-COUNT can either be a positive integer or an asterisk,
     meaning repeat as many times as necessary until the input is
     exhausted.

   The output files' names consist of a prefix (`xx' by default)
followed by a suffix.  By default, the suffix is an ascending sequence
of two-digit decimal numbers from `00' and up to `99'.  In any case,
concatenating the output files in sorted order by filename produces the
original input file.

   By default, if `csplit' encounters an error or receives a hangup,
interrupt, quit, or terminate signal, it removes any output files that
it has created so far before it exits.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-f PREFIX'
`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Use PREFIX as the output file name prefix.

`-b SUFFIX'
`--suffix=SUFFIX'
     Use SUFFIX as the output file name suffix.  When this option is
     specified, the suffix string must include exactly one
     `printf(3)'-style conversion specification, possibly including
     format specification flags, a field width, a precision
     specifications, or all of these kinds of modifiers.  The format
     letter must convert a binary integer argument to readable form;
     thus, only `d', `i', `u', `o', `x', and `X' conversions are
     allowed.  The entire SUFFIX is given (with the current output file
     number) to `sprintf(3)' to form the file name suffixes for each of
     the individual output files in turn.  If this option is used, the
     `--digits' option is ignored.

`-n DIGITS'
`--digits=DIGITS'
     Use output file names containing numbers that are DIGITS digits
     long instead of the default 2.

`-k'
`--keep-files'
     Do not remove output files when errors are encountered.

`-z'
`--elide-empty-files'
     Suppress the generation of zero-length output files.  (In cases
     where the section delimiters of the input file are supposed to
     mark the first lines of each of the sections, the first output
     file will generally be a zero-length file unless you use this
     option.)  The output file sequence numbers always run
     consecutively starting from 0, even when this option is specified.

`-s'
`-q'
`--silent'
`--quiet'
     Do not print counts of output file sizes.

`wc': Print byte, word, and line counts
=======================================

   `wc' counts the number of bytes, whitespace-separated words, and
newlines in each given FILE, or standard input if none are given or for
a FILE of `-'.  Synopsis:

     wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `wc' prints one line of counts for each file, and if the file was
given as an argument, it prints the file name following the counts.  If
more than one FILE is given, `wc' prints a final line containing the
cumulative counts, with the file name `total'.  The counts are printed
in this order: newlines, words, bytes.  By default, each count is
output right-justified in a 7-byte field with one space between fields
so that the numbers and file names line up nicely in columns.  However,
POSIX requires that there be exactly one space separating columns.  You
can make `wc' use the POSIX-mandated output format by setting the
`POSIXLY_CORRECT' environment variable.

   By default, `wc' prints all three counts.  Options can specify that
only certain counts be printed.  Options do not undo others previously
given, so

     wc --bytes --words

prints both the byte counts and the word counts.

   With the `--max-line-length' option, `wc' prints the length of the
longest line per file, and if there is more than one file it prints the
maximum (not the sum) of those lengths.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-c'
`--bytes'
`--chars'
     Print only the byte counts.

`-w'
`--words'
     Print only the word counts.

`-l'
`--lines'
     Print only the newline counts.

`-L'
`--max-line-length'
     Print only the maximum line lengths.


File: textutils.info,  Node: sum invocation,  Next: cksum invocation,  Prev: wc invocation,  Up: Summarizing files

`sum': Print checksum and block counts
======================================

   `sum' computes a 16-bit checksum for each given FILE, or standard
input if none are given or for a FILE of `-'.  Synopsis:

     sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `sum' prints the checksum for each FILE followed by the number of
blocks in the file (rounded up).  If more than one FILE is given, file
names are also printed (by default).  (With the `--sysv' option,
corresponding file name are printed when there is at least one file
argument.)

   By default, GNU `sum' computes checksums using an algorithm
compatible with BSD `sum' and prints file sizes in units of 1024-byte
blocks.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-r'
     Use the default (BSD compatible) algorithm.  This option is
     included for compatibility with the System V `sum'.  Unless `-s'
     was also given, it has no effect.

`-s'
`--sysv'
     Compute checksums using an algorithm compatible with System V
     `sum''s default, and print file sizes in units of 512-byte blocks.

   `sum' is provided for compatibility; the `cksum' program (see next
section) is preferable in new applications.


File: textutils.info,  Node: cksum invocation,  Next: md5sum invocation,  Prev: sum invocation,  Up: Summarizing files

`cksum': Print CRC checksum and byte counts
===========================================

   `cksum' computes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum for each
given FILE, or standard input if none are given or for a FILE of `-'.
Synopsis:

     cksum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `cksum' prints the CRC checksum for each file along with the number
of bytes in the file, and the filename unless no arguments were given.

   `cksum' is typically used to ensure that files transferred by
unreliable means (e.g., netnews) have not been corrupted, by comparing
the `cksum' output for the received files with the `cksum' output for
the original files (typically given in the distribution).

   The CRC algorithm is specified by the POSIX.2 standard.  It is not
compatible with the BSD or System V `sum' algorithms (see the previous
section); it is more robust.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.


File: textutils.info,  Node: md5sum invocation,  Prev: cksum invocation,  Up: Summarizing files

`md5sum': Print or check message-digests
========================================

   `md5sum' computes a 128-bit checksum (or "fingerprint" or
"message-digest") for each specified FILE.  If a FILE is specified as
`-' or if no files are given `md5sum' computes the checksum for the
standard input.  `md5sum' can also determine whether a file and
checksum are consistent. Synopses:

     md5sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     md5sum [OPTION]... --check [FILE]

   For each FILE, `md5sum' outputs the MD5 checksum, a flag indicating
a binary or text input file, and the filename.  If FILE is omitted or
specified as `-', standard input is read.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b'
`--binary'
     Treat all input files as binary.  This option has no effect on Unix
     systems, since they don't distinguish between binary and text
     files.  This option is useful on systems that have different
     internal and external character representations.  On MS-DOS and
     MS-Windows, this is the default.

`-c'
`--check'
     Read filenames and checksum information from the single FILE (or
     from stdin if no FILE was specified) and report whether each named
     file and the corresponding checksum data are consistent.  The
     input to this mode of `md5sum' is usually the output of a prior,
     checksum-generating run of `md5sum'.  Each valid line of input
     consists of an MD5 checksum, a binary/text flag, and then a
     filename.  Binary files are marked with `*', text with ` '.  For
     each such line, `md5sum' reads the named file and computes its MD5
     checksum.  Then, if the computed message digest does not match the
     one on the line with the filename, the file is noted as having
     failed the test.  Otherwise, the file passes the test.  By
     default, for each valid line, one line is written to standard
     output indicating whether the named file passed the test.  After
     all checks have been performed, if there were any failures, a
     warning is issued to standard error.  Use the `--status' option to
     inhibit that output.  If any listed file cannot be opened or read,
     if any valid line has an MD5 checksum inconsistent with the
     associated file, or if no valid line is found, `md5sum' exits with
     nonzero status.  Otherwise, it exits successfully.

`--status'
     This option is useful only when verifying checksums.  When
     verifying checksums, don't generate the default one-line-per-file
     diagnostic and don't output the warning summarizing any failures.
     Failures to open or read a file still evoke individual diagnostics
     to standard error.  If all listed files are readable and are
     consistent with the associated MD5 checksums, exit successfully.
     Otherwise exit with a status code indicating there was a failure.

`-t'
`--text'
     Treat all input files as text files.  This is the reverse of
     `--binary'.

`-w'
`--warn'
     When verifying checksums, warn about improperly formatted MD5
     checksum lines.  This option is useful only if all but a few lines
     in the checked input are valid.

File: textutils.info,  Node: sort invocation,  Next: uniq invocation,  Up: Operating on sorted files

`sort': Sort text files
=======================

   `sort' sorts, merges, or compares all the lines from the given
files, or standard input if none are given or for a FILE of `-'.  By
default, `sort' writes the results to standard output.  Synopsis:

     sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   `sort' has three modes of operation: sort (the default), merge, and
check for sortedness.  The following options change the operation mode:

`-c'
     Check whether the given files are already sorted: if they are not
     all sorted, print an error message and exit with a status of 1.
     Otherwise, exit successfully.

`-m'
     Merge the given files by sorting them as a group.  Each input file
     must always be individually sorted.  It always works to sort
     instead of merge; merging is provided because it is faster, in the
     case where it works.

   A pair of lines is compared as follows: if any key fields have been
specified, `sort' compares each pair of fields, in the order specified
on the command line, according to the associated ordering options,
until a difference is found or no fields are left.  Unless otherwise
specified, all comparisons use the character collating sequence
specified by the `LC_COLLATE' locale.

   If any of the global options `Mbdfinr' are given but no key fields
are specified, `sort' compares the entire lines according to the global
options.

   Finally, as a last resort when all keys compare equal (or if no
ordering options were specified at all), `sort' compares the entire
lines.  The last resort comparison honors the `-r' global option.  The
`-s' (stable) option disables this last-resort comparison so that lines
in which all fields compare equal are left in their original relative
order.  If no fields or global options are specified, `-s' has no
effect.

   GNU `sort' (as specified for all GNU utilities) has no limits on
input line length or restrictions on bytes allowed within lines.  In
addition, if the final byte of an input file is not a newline, GNU
`sort' silently supplies one.  A line's trailing newline is part of the
line for comparison purposes; for example, with no options in an ASCII
locale, a line starting with a tab sorts before an empty line because
tab precedes newline in the ASCII collating sequence.

   Upon any error, `sort' exits with a status of `2'.

   If the environment variable `TMPDIR' is set, `sort' uses its value
as the directory for temporary files instead of `/tmp'.  The `-T
TEMPDIR' option in turn overrides the environment variable.

   The following options affect the ordering of output lines.  They may
be specified globally or as part of a specific key field.  If no key
fields are specified, global options apply to comparison of entire
lines; otherwise the global options are inherited by key fields that do
not specify any special options of their own.  The `-b', `-d', `-f' and
`-i' options classify characters according to the `LC_CTYPE' locale.

`-b'
     Ignore leading blanks when finding sort keys in each line.

`-d'
     Sort in "phone directory" order: ignore all characters except
     letters, digits and blanks when sorting.

`-f'
     Fold lowercase characters into the equivalent uppercase characters
     when sorting so that, for example, `b' and `B' sort as equal.

`-g'
     Sort numerically, using the standard C function `strtod' to convert
     a prefix of each line to a double-precision floating point number.
     This allows floating point numbers to be specified in scientific
     notation, like `1.0e-34' and `10e100'.  Do not report overflow,
     underflow, or conversion errors.  Use the following collating
     sequence:

        * Lines that do not start with numbers (all considered to be
          equal).

        * NaNs ("Not a Number" values, in IEEE floating point
          arithmetic) in a consistent but machine-dependent order.

        * Minus infinity.

        * Finite numbers in ascending numeric order (with -0 and +0
          equal).

        * Plus infinity.

     Use this option only if there is no alternative; it is much slower
     than `-n' and it can lose information when converting to floating
     point.

`-i'
     Ignore unprintable characters.

`-M'
     An initial string, consisting of any amount of whitespace, followed
     by a month name abbreviation, is folded to UPPER case and compared
     in the order `JAN' < `FEB' < ... < `DEC'.  Invalid names compare
     low to valid names.  The `LC_TIME' locale determines the month
     spellings.

`-n'
     Sort numerically: the number begins each line; specifically, it
     consists of optional whitespace, an optional `-' sign, and zero or
     more digits possibly separated by thousands separators, optionally
     followed by a radix character and zero or more digits.  The
     `LC_NUMERIC' locale specifies the radix character and thousands
     separator.

     `sort -n' uses what might be considered an unconventional method
     to compare strings representing floating point numbers.  Rather
     than first converting each string to the C `double' type and then
     comparing those values, sort aligns the radix characters in the two
     strings and compares the strings a character at a time.  One
     benefit of using this approach is its speed.  In practice this is
     much more efficient than performing the two corresponding
     string-to-double (or even string-to-integer) conversions and then
     comparing doubles.  In addition, there is no corresponding loss of
     precision.  Converting each string to `double' before comparison
     would limit precision to about 16 digits on most systems.

     Neither a leading `+' nor exponential notation is recognized.  To
     compare such strings numerically, use the `-g' option.

`-r'
     Reverse the result of comparison, so that lines with greater key
     values appear earlier in the output instead of later.

   Other options are:

`-o OUTPUT-FILE'
     Write output to OUTPUT-FILE instead of standard output.  If
     OUTPUT-FILE is one of the input files, `sort' copies it to a
     temporary file before sorting and writing the output to
     OUTPUT-FILE.

`-t SEPARATOR'
     Use character SEPARATOR as the field separator when finding the
     sort keys in each line.  By default, fields are separated by the
     empty string between a non-whitespace character and a whitespace
     character.  That is, given the input line ` foo bar', `sort'
     breaks it into fields ` foo' and ` bar'.  The field separator is
     not considered to be part of either the field preceding or the
     field following.

`-u'
     For the default case or the `-m' option, only output the first of
     a sequence of lines that compare equal.  For the `-c' option,
     check that no pair of consecutive lines compares equal.

`-k POS1[,POS2]'
     The recommended, POSIX, option for specifying a sort field.  The
     field consists of the part of the line between POS1 and POS2 (or
     the end of the line, if POS2 is omitted), _inclusive_.  Fields and
     character positions are numbered starting with 1.  So to sort on
     the second field, you'd use `-k 2,2' See below for more examples.

`-z'
     Treat the input as a set of lines, each terminated by a zero byte
     (ASCII NUL (Null) character) instead of an ASCII LF (Line Feed).
     This option can be useful in conjunction with `perl -0' or `find
     -print0' and `xargs -0' which do the same in order to reliably
     handle arbitrary pathnames (even those which contain Line Feed
     characters.)

`+POS1[-POS2]'
     The obsolete, traditional option for specifying a sort field.  The
     field consists of the line between POS1 and up to but _not
     including_ POS2 (or the end of the line if POS2 is omitted).
     Fields and character positions are numbered starting with 0.  See
     below.

   In addition, when GNU `sort' is invoked with exactly one argument,
options `--help' and `--version' are recognized.  *Note Common
options::.

   Historical (BSD and System V) implementations of `sort' have
differed in their interpretation of some options, particularly `-b',
`-f', and `-n'.  GNU sort follows the POSIX behavior, which is usually
(but not always!) like the System V behavior.  According to POSIX, `-n'
no longer implies `-b'.  For consistency, `-M' has been changed in the
same way.  This may affect the meaning of character positions in field
specifications in obscure cases.  The only fix is to add an explicit
`-b'.

   A position in a sort field specified with the `-k' or `+' option has
the form `F.C', where F is the number of the field to use and C is the
number of the first character from the beginning of the field (for
`+POS') or from the end of the previous field (for `-POS').  If the `.C'
is omitted, it is taken to be the first character in the field.  If the
`-b' option was specified, the `.C' part of a field specification is
counted from the first nonblank character of the field (for `+POS') or
from the first nonblank character following the previous field (for
`-POS').

   A sort key option may also have any of the option letters `Mbdfinr'
appended to it, in which case the global ordering options are not used
for that particular field.  The `-b' option may be independently
attached to either or both of the `+POS' and `-POS' parts of a field
specification, and if it is inherited from the global options it will
be attached to both.  Keys may span multiple fields.

   Here are some examples to illustrate various combinations of options.
In them, the POSIX `-k' option is used to specify sort keys rather than
the obsolete `+POS1-POS2' syntax.

   * Sort in descending (reverse) numeric order.

          sort -nr

     Sort alphabetically, omitting the first and second fields.  This
     uses a single key composed of the characters beginning at the
     start of field three and extending to the end of each line.

          sort -k3

   * Sort numerically on the second field and resolve ties by sorting
     alphabetically on the third and fourth characters of field five.
     Use `:' as the field delimiter.

          sort -t : -k 2,2n -k 5.3,5.4

     Note that if you had written `-k 2' instead of `-k 2,2' `sort'
     would have used all characters beginning in the second field and
     extending to the end of the line as the primary _numeric_ key.
     For the large majority of applications, treating keys spanning
     more than one field as numeric will not do what you expect.

     Also note that the `n' modifier was applied to the field-end
     specifier for the first key.  It would have been equivalent to
     specify `-k 2n,2' or `-k 2n,2n'.  All modifiers except `b' apply
     to the associated _field_, regardless of whether the modifier
     character is attached to the field-start and/or the field-end part
     of the key specifier.

   * Sort the password file on the fifth field and ignore any leading
     white space.  Sort lines with equal values in field five on the
     numeric user ID in field three.

          sort -t : -k 5b,5 -k 3,3n /etc/passwd

     An alternative is to use the global numeric modifier `-n'.

          sort -t : -n -k 5b,5 -k 3,3 /etc/passwd

   * Generate a tags file in case insensitive sorted order.
          find src -type f -print0 | sort -t / -z -f | xargs -0 etags --append

     The use of `-print0', `-z', and `-0' in this case mean that
     pathnames that contain Line Feed characters will not get broken up
     by the sort operation.

     Finally, to ignore both leading and trailing white space, you
     could have applied the `b' modifier to the field-end specifier for
     the first key,

          sort -t : -n -k 5b,5b -k 3,3 /etc/passwd

     or by using the global `-b' modifier instead of `-n' and an
     explicit `n' with the second key specifier.

          sort -t : -b -k 5,5 -k 3,3n /etc/passwd

`uniq': Uniquify files
======================

   `uniq' writes the unique lines in the given `input', or standard
input if nothing is given or for an INPUT name of `-'.  Synopsis:

     uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

   By default, `uniq' prints the unique lines in a sorted file, i.e.,
discards all but one of identical successive lines.  Optionally, it can
instead show only lines that appear exactly once, or lines that appear
more than once.

   The input must be sorted.  If your input is not sorted, perhaps you
want to use `sort -u'.

   If no OUTPUT file is specified, `uniq' writes to standard output.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-N'
`-f N'
`--skip-fields=N'
     Skip N fields on each line before checking for uniqueness.  Fields
     are sequences of non-space non-tab characters that are separated
     from each other by at least one spaces or tabs.

`+N'
`-s N'
`--skip-chars=N'
     Skip N characters before checking for uniqueness.  If you use both
     the field and character skipping options, fields are skipped over
     first.

`-c'
`--count'
     Print the number of times each line occurred along with the line.

`-i'
`--ignore-case'
     Ignore differences in case when comparing lines.

`-d'
`--repeated'
     Print only duplicate lines.

`-D'
`--all-repeated'
     Print all duplicate lines and only duplicate lines.  This option
     is useful mainly in conjunction with other options e.g., to ignore
     case or to compare only selected fields.  This is a GNU extension.

`-u'
`--unique'
     Print only unique lines.

`-w N'
`--check-chars=N'
     Compare N characters on each line (after skipping any specified
     fields and characters).  By default the entire rest of the lines
     are compared.


File: textutils.info,  Node: comm invocation,  Next: ptx invocation,  Prev: uniq invocation,  Up: Operating on sorted files

`comm': Compare two sorted files line by line
=============================================

   `comm' writes to standard output lines that are common, and lines
that are unique, to two input files; a file name of `-' means standard
input.  Synopsis:

     comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

   Before `comm' can be used, the input files must be sorted using the
collating sequence specified by the `LC_COLLATE' locale, with trailing
newlines significant.  If an input file ends in a non-newline
character, a newline is silently appended.  The `sort' command with no
options always outputs a file that is suitable input to `comm'.

   With no options, `comm' produces three column output.  Column one
contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to
FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.  Columns
are separated by a single TAB character.

   The options `-1', `-2', and `-3' suppress printing of the
corresponding columns.  Also see *Note Common options::.

   Unlike some other comparison utilities, `comm' has an exit status
that does not depend on the result of the comparison.  Upon normal
completion `comm' produces an exit code of zero.  If there is an error
it exits with nonzero status.

`tsort': Topological sort
=========================

   `tsort' performs a topological sort on the given FILE, or standard
input if no input file is given or for a FILE of `-'.  Synopsis:

     tsort [OPTION] [FILE]

   `tsort' reads its input as pairs of strings, separated by blanks,
indicating a partial ordering.  The output is a total ordering that
corresponds to the given partial ordering.

   For example

     tsort <<EOF
     a b c
     d
     e f
     b c d e
     EOF

will produce the output

     a
     b
     c
     d
     e
     f

   `tsort' will detect cycles in the input and writes the first cycle
encountered to standard error.

   Note that for a given partial ordering, generally there is no unique
total ordering.

   The only options are `--help' and `--version'.  *Note Common
options::.

`ptx': Produce permuted indexes
===============================

   `ptx' reads a text file and essentially produces a permuted index,
with each keyword in its context.  The calling sketch is either one of:

     ptx [OPTION ...] [FILE ...]
     ptx -G [OPTION ...] [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

   The `-G' (or its equivalent: `--traditional') option disables all
GNU extensions and revert to traditional mode, thus introducing some
limitations, and changes several of the program's default option values.
When `-G' is not specified, GNU extensions are always enabled.  GNU
extensions to `ptx' are documented wherever appropriate in this
document.  For the full list, see *Note Compatibility in ptx::.

   Individual options are explained in incoming sections.

   When GNU extensions are enabled, there may be zero, one or several
FILE after the options.  If there is no FILE, the program reads the
standard input.  If there is one or several FILE, they give the name of
input files which are all read in turn, as if all the input files were
concatenated.  However, there is a full contextual break between each
file and, when automatic referencing is requested, file names and line
numbers refer to individual text input files.  In all cases, the
program produces the permuted index onto the standard output.

   When GNU extensions are _not_ enabled, that is, when the program
operates in traditional mode, there may be zero, one or two parameters
besides the options.  If there is no parameters, the program reads the
standard input and produces the permuted index onto the standard output.
If there is only one parameter, it names the text INPUT to be read
instead of the standard input.  If two parameters are given, they give
respectively the name of the INPUT file to read and the name of the
OUTPUT file to produce.  _Be very careful_ to note that, in this case,
the contents of file given by the second parameter is destroyed.  This
behaviour is dictated only by System V `ptx' compatibility, because GNU
Standards discourage output parameters not introduced by an option.

   Note that for _any_ file named as the value of an option or as an
input text file, a single dash `-' may be used, in which case standard
input is assumed.  However, it would not make sense to use this
convention more than once per program invocation.

General options
---------------

`-C'
`--copyright'
     Prints a short note about the Copyright and copying conditions,
     then exit without further processing.

`-G'
`--traditional'
     As already explained, this option disables all GNU extensions to
     `ptx' and switch to traditional mode.

`--help'
     Prints a short help on standard output, then exit without further
     processing.

`--version'
     Prints the program verison on standard output, then exit without
     further processing.


File: textutils.info,  Node: Charset selection in ptx,  Next: Input processing in ptx,  Prev: General options in ptx,  Up: ptx invocation

Charset selection
-----------------

   As it is setup now, the program assumes that the input file is coded
using 8-bit ISO 8859-1 code, also known as Latin-1 character set,
_unless_ if it is compiled for MS-DOS, in which case it uses the
character set of the IBM-PC.  (GNU `ptx' is not known to work on
smaller MS-DOS machines anymore.)  Compared to 7-bit ASCII, the set of
characters which are letters is then different, this fact alters the
behaviour of regular expression matching.  Thus, the default regular
expression for a keyword allows foreign or diacriticized letters.
Keyword sorting, however, is still crude; it obeys the underlying
character set ordering quite blindly.

`-f'
`--ignore-case'
     Fold lower case letters to upper case for sorting.

Word selection and input processing
-----------------------------------

`-b FILE'

`--break-file=FILE'
     This option provides an alternative (to `-W') method of describing
     which characters make up words.  It introduces the name of a file
     which contains a list of characters which can_not_ be part of one
     word, this file is called the "Break file".  Any character which
     is not part of the Break file is a word constituent.  If both
     options `-b' and `-W' are specified, then `-W' has precedence and
     `-b' is ignored.

     When GNU extensions are enabled, the only way to avoid newline as a
     break character is to write all the break characters in the file
     with no newline at all, not even at the end of the file.  When GNU
     extensions are disabled, spaces, tabs and newlines are always
     considered as break characters even if not included in the Break
     file.

`-i FILE'
`--ignore-file=FILE'
     The file associated with this option contains a list of words
     which will never be taken as keywords in concordance output.  It
     is called the "Ignore file".  The file contains exactly one word
     in each line; the end of line separation of words is not subject
     to the value of the `-S' option.

     There is a default Ignore file used by `ptx' when this option is
     not specified, usually found in `/usr/local/lib/eign' if this has
     not been changed at installation time.  If you want to deactivate
     the default Ignore file, specify `/dev/null' instead.

`-o FILE'
`--only-file=FILE'
     The file associated with this option contains a list of words
     which will be retained in concordance output, any word not
     mentioned in this file is ignored.  The file is called the "Only
     file".  The file contains exactly one word in each line; the end
     of line separation of words is not subject to the value of the
     `-S' option.

     There is no default for the Only file.  In the case there are both
     an Only file and an Ignore file, a word will be subject to be a
     keyword only if it is given in the Only file and not given in the
     Ignore file.

`-r'
`--references'
     On each input line, the leading sequence of non white characters
     will be taken to be a reference that has the purpose of
     identifying this input line on the produced permuted index.  For
     more information about reference production, see *Note Output
     formatting in ptx::.  Using this option changes the default value
     for option `-S'.

     Using this option, the program does not try very hard to remove
     references from contexts in output, but it succeeds in doing so
     _when_ the context ends exactly at the newline.  If option `-r' is
     used with `-S' default value, or when GNU extensions are disabled,
     this condition is always met and references are completely
     excluded from the output contexts.

`-S REGEXP'
`--sentence-regexp=REGEXP'
     This option selects which regular expression will describe the end
     of a line or the end of a sentence.  In fact, there is other
     distinction between end of lines or end of sentences than the
     effect of this regular expression, and input line boundaries have
     no special significance outside this option.  By default, when GNU
     extensions are enabled and if `-r' option is not used, end of
     sentences are used.  In this case, the precise REGEX is imported
     from GNU emacs:

          [.?!][]\"')}]*\\($\\|\t\\|  \\)[ \t\n]*

     Whenever GNU extensions are disabled or if `-r' option is used, end
     of lines are used; in this case, the default REGEXP is just:

          \n

     Using an empty REGEXP is equivalent to completely disabling end of
     line or end of sentence recognition.  In this case, the whole file
     is considered to be a single big line or sentence.  The user might
     want to disallow all truncation flag generation as well, through
     option `-F ""'.  *Note Syntax of Regular Expressions:
     (emacs)Regexps.

     When the keywords happen to be near the beginning of the input
     line or sentence, this often creates an unused area at the
     beginning of the output context line; when the keywords happen to
     be near the end of the input line or sentence, this often creates
     an unused area at the end of the output context line.  The program
     tries to fill those unused areas by wrapping around context in
     them; the tail of the input line or sentence is used to fill the
     unused area on the left of the output line; the head of the input
     line or sentence is used to fill the unused area on the right of
     the output line.

     As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed
     escape sequences, as found in the C language, are recognized and
     converted to the corresponding characters by `ptx' itself.

`-W REGEXP'
`--word-regexp=REGEXP'
     This option selects which regular expression will describe each
     keyword.  By default, if GNU extensions are enabled, a word is a
     sequence of letters; the REGEXP used is `\w+'.  When GNU
     extensions are disabled, a word is by default anything which ends
     with a space, a tab or a newline; the REGEXP used is `[^ \t\n]+'.

     An empty REGEXP is equivalent to not using this option, letting the
     default dive in.  *Note Syntax of Regular Expressions:
     (emacs)Regexps.

     As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed
     escape sequences, as found in the C language, are recognized and

Output formatting
-----------------

   Output format is mainly controlled by `-O' and `-T' options,
described in the table below.  When neither `-O' nor `-T' is selected,
and if GNU extensions are enabled, the program choose an output format
suited for a dumb terminal.  Each keyword occurrence is output to the
center of one line, surrounded by its left and right contexts.  Each
field is properly justified, so the concordance output could readily be
observed.  As a special feature, if automatic references are selected
by option `-A' and are output before the left context, that is, if
option `-R' is _not_ selected, then a colon is added after the
reference; this nicely interfaces with GNU Emacs `next-error'
processing.  In this default output format, each white space character,
like newline and tab, is merely changed to exactly one space, with no
special attempt to compress consecutive spaces.  This might change in
the future.  Except for those white space characters, every other
character of the underlying set of 256 characters is transmitted
verbatim.

   Output format is further controlled by the following options.

`-g NUMBER'
`--gap-size=NUMBER'
     Select the size of the minimum white gap between the fields on the
     output line.

`-w NUMBER'
`--width=NUMBER'
     Select the output maximum width of each final line.  If references
     are used, they are included or excluded from the output maximum
     width depending on the value of option `-R'.  If this option is not
     selected, that is, when references are output before the left
     context, the output maximum width takes into account the maximum
     length of all references.  If this options is selected, that is,
     when references are output after the right context, the output
     maximum width does not take into account the space taken by
     references, nor the gap that precedes them.

`-A'
`--auto-reference'
     Select automatic references.  Each input line will have an
     automatic reference made up of the file name and the line ordinal,
     with a single colon between them.  However, the file name will be
     empty when standard input is being read.  If both `-A' and `-r'
     are selected, then the input reference is still read and skipped,
     but the automatic reference is used at output time, overriding the
     input reference.

`-R'
`--right-side-refs'
     In default output format, when option `-R' is not used, any
     reference produced by the effect of options `-r' or `-A' are given
     to the far right of output lines, after the right context.  In
     default output format, when option `-R' is specified, references
     are rather given to the beginning of each output line, before the
     left context.  For any other output format, option `-R' is almost
     ignored, except for the fact that the width of references is _not_
     taken into account in total output width given by `-w' whenever
     `-R' is selected.

     This option is automatically selected whenever GNU extensions are
     disabled.

`-F STRING'
`--flac-truncation=STRING'
     This option will request that any truncation in the output be
     reported using the string STRING.  Most output fields
     theoretically extend towards the beginning or the end of the
     current line, or current sentence, as selected with option `-S'.
     But there is a maximum allowed output line width, changeable
     through option `-w', which is further divided into space for
     various output fields.  When a field has to be truncated because
     cannot extend until the beginning or the end of the current line
     to fit in the, then a truncation occurs.  By default, the string
     used is a single slash, as in `-F /'.

     STRING may have more than one character, as in `-F ...'.  Also, in
     the particular case STRING is empty (`-F ""'), truncation flagging
     is disabled, and no truncation marks are appended in this case.

     As a matter of convenience to the user, many usual backslashed
     escape sequences, as found in the C language, are recognized and
     converted to the corresponding characters by `ptx' itself.

`-M STRING'
`--macro-name=STRING'
     Select another STRING to be used instead of `xx', while generating
     output suitable for `nroff', `troff' or TeX.

`-O'
`--format=roff'
     Choose an output format suitable for `nroff' or `troff'
     processing.  Each output line will look like:

          .xx "TAIL" "BEFORE" "KEYWORD_AND_AFTER" "HEAD" "REF"

     so it will be possible to write an `.xx' roff macro to take care of
     the output typesetting.  This is the default output format when GNU
     extensions are disabled.  Option `-M' might be used to change `xx'
     to another macro name.

     In this output format, each non-graphical character, like newline
     and tab, is merely changed to exactly one space, with no special
     attempt to compress consecutive spaces.  Each quote character: `"'
     is doubled so it will be correctly processed by `nroff' or `troff'.

`-T'
`--format=tex'
     Choose an output format suitable for TeX processing.  Each output
     line will look like:

          \xx {TAIL}{BEFORE}{KEYWORD}{AFTER}{HEAD}{REF}

     so it will be possible to write a `\xx' definition to take care of
     the output typesetting.  Note that when references are not being
     produced, that is, neither option `-A' nor option `-r' is
     selected, the last parameter of each `\xx' call is inhibited.
     Option `-M' might be used to change `xx' to another macro name.

     In this output format, some special characters, like `$', `%',
     `&', `#' and `_' are automatically protected with a backslash.
     Curly brackets `{', `}' are also protected with a backslash, but
     also enclosed in a pair of dollar signs to force mathematical
     mode.  The backslash itself produces the sequence `\backslash{}'.
     Circumflex and tilde diacritics produce the sequence `^\{ }' and
     `~\{ }' respectively.  Other diacriticized characters of the
     underlying character set produce an appropriate TeX sequence as
     far as possible.  The other non-graphical characters, like newline
     and tab, and all others characters which are not part of ASCII,
     are merely changed to exactly one space, with no special attempt
     to compress consecutive spaces.  Let me know how to improve this
     special character processing for TeX.

The GNU extensions to `ptx'
---------------------------

   This version of `ptx' contains a few features which do not exist in
System V `ptx'.  These extra features are suppressed by using the `-G'
command line option, unless overridden by other command line options.
Some GNU extensions cannot be recovered by overriding, so the simple
rule is to avoid `-G' if you care about GNU extensions.  Here are the
differences between this program and System V `ptx'.

   * This program can read many input files at once, it always writes
     the resulting concordance on standard output.  On the other end,
     System V `ptx' reads only one file and produce the result on
     standard output or, if a second FILE parameter is given on the
     command, to that FILE.

     Having output parameters not introduced by options is a quite
     dangerous practice which GNU avoids as far as possible.  So, for
     using `ptx' portably between GNU and System V, you should pay
     attention to always use it with a single input file, and always
     expect the result on standard output.  You might also want to
     automatically configure in a `-G' option to `ptx' calls in
     products using `ptx', if the configurator finds that the installed
     `ptx' accepts `-G'.

   * The only options available in System V `ptx' are options `-b',
     `-f', `-g', `-i', `-o', `-r', `-t' and `-w'.  All other options
     are GNU extensions and are not repeated in this enumeration.
     Moreover, some options have a slightly different meaning when GNU
     extensions are enabled, as explained below.

   * By default, concordance output is not formatted for `troff' or
     `nroff'.  It is rather formatted for a dumb terminal.  `troff' or
     `nroff' output may still be selected through option `-O'.

   * Unless `-R' option is used, the maximum reference width is
     subtracted from the total output line width.  With GNU extensions
     disabled, width of references is not taken into account in the
     output line width computations.

   * All 256 characters, even `NUL's, are always read and processed from
     input file with no adverse effect, even if GNU extensions are
     disabled.  However, System V `ptx' does not accept 8-bit
     characters, a few control characters are rejected, and the tilde
     `~' is condemned.

   * Input line length is only limited by available memory, even if GNU
     extensions are disabled.  However, System V `ptx' processes only
     the first 200 characters in each line.

   * The break (non-word) characters default to be every character
     except all letters of the underlying character set, diacriticized
     or not.  When GNU extensions are disabled, the break characters
     default to space, tab and newline only.

   * The program makes better use of output line width.  If GNU
     extensions are disabled, the program rather tries to imitate
     System V `ptx', but still, there are some slight disposition
     glitches this program does not completely reproduce.

   * The user can specify both an Ignore file and an Only file.  This
     is not allowed with System V `ptx'.

`cut': Print selected parts of lines
====================================

   `cut' writes to standard output selected parts of each line of each
input file, or standard input if no files are given or for a file name
of `-'.  Synopsis:

     cut [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   In the table which follows, the BYTE-LIST, CHARACTER-LIST, and
FIELD-LIST are one or more numbers or ranges (two numbers separated by
a dash) separated by commas.  Bytes, characters, and fields are
numbered from starting at 1.  Incomplete ranges may be given: `-M'
means `1-M'; `N-' means `N' through end of line or last field.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-b BYTE-LIST'
`--bytes=BYTE-LIST'
     Print only the bytes in positions listed in BYTE-LIST.  Tabs and
     backspaces are treated like any other character; they take up 1
     byte.

`-c CHARACTER-LIST'
`--characters=CHARACTER-LIST'
     Print only characters in positions listed in CHARACTER-LIST.  The
     same as `-b' for now, but internationalization will change that.
     Tabs and backspaces are treated like any other character; they
     take up 1 character.

`-f FIELD-LIST'
`--fields=FIELD-LIST'
     Print only the fields listed in FIELD-LIST.  Fields are separated
     by a TAB character by default.

`-d INPUT_DELIM_BYTE'
`--delimiter=INPUT_DELIM_BYTE'
     For `-f', fields are separated in the input by the first character
     in INPUT_DELIM_BYTE (default is TAB).

`-n'
     Do not split multi-byte characters (no-op for now).

`-s'
`--only-delimited'
     For `-f', do not print lines that do not contain the field
     separator character.

`--output-delimiter=OUTPUT_DELIM_STRING'
     For `-f', output fields are separated by OUTPUT_DELIM_STRING The
     default is to use the input delimiter.

`paste': Merge lines of files
=============================

   `paste' writes to standard output lines consisting of sequentially
corresponding lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character.
Standard input is used for a file name of `-' or if no input files are
given.

   Synopsis:

     paste [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-s'
`--serial'
     Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one line from
     each file.

`-d DELIM-LIST'
`--delimiters DELIM-LIST'
     Consecutively use the characters in DELIM-LIST instead of TAB to
     separate merged lines.  When DELIM-LIST is exhausted, start again
     at its beginning.


File: textutils.info,  Node: join invocation,  Prev: paste invocation,  Up: Operating on fields within a line

`join': Join lines on a common field
====================================

   `join' writes to standard output a line for each pair of input lines
that have identical join fields.  Synopsis:

     join [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

   Either FILE1 or FILE2 (but not both) can be `-', meaning standard
input.  FILE1 and FILE2 should be already sorted in increasing textual
order on the join fields, using the collating sequence specified by the
`LC_COLLATE' locale.  Unless the `-t' option is given, the input should
be sorted ignoring blanks at the start of the join field, as in `sort
-b'.  If the `--ignore-case' option is given, lines should be sorted
without regard to the case of characters in the join field, as in `sort
-f'.

   The defaults are: the join field is the first field in each line;
fields in the input are separated by one or more blanks, with leading
blanks on the line ignored; fields in the output are separated by a
space; each output line consists of the join field, the remaining
fields from FILE1, then the remaining fields from FILE2.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-a FILE-NUMBER'
     Print a line for each unpairable line in file FILE-NUMBER (either
     `1' or `2'), in addition to the normal output.

`-e STRING'
     Replace those output fields that are missing in the input with
     STRING.

`-i'
`--ignore-case'
     Ignore differences in case when comparing keys.  With this option,
     the lines of the input files must be ordered in the same way.  Use
     `sort -f' to produce this ordering.

`-1 FIELD'
`-j1 FIELD'
     Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 1.

`-2 FIELD'
`-j2 FIELD'
     Join on field FIELD (a positive integer) of file 2.

`-j FIELD'
     Equivalent to `-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'.

`-o FIELD-LIST...'
     Construct each output line according to the format in FIELD-LIST.
     Each element in FIELD-LIST is either the single character `0' or
     has the form M.N where the file number, M, is `1' or `2' and N is
     a positive field number.

     A field specification of `0' denotes the join field.  In most
     cases, the functionality of the `0' field spec may be reproduced
     using the explicit M.N that corresponds to the join field.
     However, when printing unpairable lines (using either of the `-a'
     or `-v' options), there is no way to specify the join field using
     M.N in FIELD-LIST if there are unpairable lines in both files.  To
     give `join' that functionality, POSIX invented the `0' field
     specification notation.

     The elements in FIELD-LIST are separated by commas or blanks.
     Multiple FIELD-LIST arguments can be given after a single `-o'
     option; the values of all lists given with `-o' are concatenated
     together.  All output lines - including those printed because of
     any -a or -v option - are subject to the specified FIELD-LIST.

`-t CHAR'
     Use character CHAR as the input and output field separator.

`-v FILE-NUMBER'
     Print a line for each unpairable line in file FILE-NUMBER (either
     `1' or `2'), instead of the normal output.

   In addition, when GNU `join' is invoked with exactly one argument,
options `--help' and `--version' are recognized.  *Note Common

`tr': Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters
==================================================

   Synopsis:

     tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]

   `tr' copies standard input to standard output, performing one of the
following operations:

   * translate, and optionally squeeze repeated characters in the
     result,

   * squeeze repeated characters,

   * delete characters,

   * delete characters, then squeeze repeated characters from the
     result.

   The SET1 and (if given) SET2 arguments define ordered sets of
characters, referred to below as SET1 and SET2.  These sets are the
characters of the input that `tr' operates on.  The `--complement'
(`-c') option replaces SET1 with its complement (all of the characters
that are not in SET1).

Specifying sets of characters
-----------------------------

   The format of the SET1 and SET2 arguments resembles the format of
regular expressions; however, they are not regular expressions, only
lists of characters.  Most characters simply represent themselves in
these strings, but the strings can contain the shorthands listed below,
for convenience.  Some of them can be used only in SET1 or SET2, as
noted below.

Backslash escapes
     A backslash followed by a character not listed below causes an
     error message.

    `\a'
          Control-G.

    `\b'
          Control-H.

    `\f'
          Control-L.

    `\n'
          Control-J.

    `\r'
          Control-M.

    `\t'
          Control-I.

    `\v'
          Control-K.

    `\OOO'
          The character with the value given by OOO, which is 1 to 3
          octal digits,

    `\\'
          A backslash.

Ranges
     The notation `M-N' expands to all of the characters from M through
     N, in ascending order.  M should collate before N; if it doesn't,
     an error results.  As an example, `0-9' is the same as
     `0123456789'.  Although GNU `tr' does not support the System V
     syntax that uses square brackets to enclose ranges, translations
     specified in that format will still work as long as the brackets
     in STRING1 correspond to identical brackets in STRING2.

Repeated characters
     The notation `[C*N]' in SET2 expands to N copies of character C.
     Thus, `[y*6]' is the same as `yyyyyy'.  The notation `[C*]' in
     STRING2 expands to as many copies of C as are needed to make SET2
     as long as SET1.  If N begins with `0', it is interpreted in
     octal, otherwise in decimal.

Character classes
     The notation `[:CLASS:]' expands to all of the characters in the
     (predefined) class CLASS.  The characters expand in no particular
     order, except for the `upper' and `lower' classes, which expand in
     ascending order.  When the `--delete' (`-d') and
     `--squeeze-repeats' (`-s') options are both given, any character
     class can be used in SET2.  Otherwise, only the character classes
     `lower' and `upper' are accepted in SET2, and then only if the
     corresponding character class (`upper' and `lower', respectively)
     is specified in the same relative position in SET1.  Doing this
     specifies case conversion.  The class names are given below; an
     error results when an invalid class name is given.

    `alnum'
          Letters and digits.

    `alpha'
          Letters.

    `blank'
          Horizontal whitespace.

    `cntrl'
          Control characters.

    `digit'
          Digits.

    `graph'
          Printable characters, not including space.

    `lower'
          Lowercase letters.

    `print'
          Printable characters, including space.

    `punct'
          Punctuation characters.

    `space'
          Horizontal or vertical whitespace.

    `upper'
          Uppercase letters.

    `xdigit'
          Hexadecimal digits.

Equivalence classes
     The syntax `[=C=]' expands to all of the characters that are
     equivalent to C, in no particular order.  Equivalence classes are
     a relatively recent invention intended to support non-English
     alphabets.  But there seems to be no standard way to define them
     or determine their contents.  Therefore, they are not fully
     implemented in GNU `tr'; each character's equivalence class
     consists only of that character, which is of no particular use.


File: textutils.info,  Node: Translating,  Next: Squeezing,  Prev: Character sets,  Up: tr invocation

Translating
-----------

   `tr' performs translation when SET1 and SET2 are both given and the
`--delete' (`-d') option is not given.  `tr' translates each character
of its input that is in SET1 to the corresponding character in SET2.
Characters not in SET1 are passed through unchanged.  When a character
appears more than once in SET1 and the corresponding characters in SET2
are not all the same, only the final one is used.  For example, these
two commands are equivalent:

     tr aaa xyz
     tr a z

   A common use of `tr' is to convert lowercase characters to
uppercase.  This can be done in many ways.  Here are three of them:

     tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
     tr a-z A-Z
     tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'

   When `tr' is performing translation, SET1 and SET2 typically have
the same length.  If SET1 is shorter than SET2, the extra characters at
the end of SET2 are ignored.

   On the other hand, making SET1 longer than SET2 is not portable;
POSIX.2 says that the result is undefined.  In this situation, BSD `tr'
pads SET2 to the length of SET1 by repeating the last character of SET2
as many times as necessary.  System V `tr' truncates SET1 to the length
of SET2.

   By default, GNU `tr' handles this case like BSD `tr'.  When the
`--truncate-set1' (`-t') option is given, GNU `tr' handles this case
like the System V `tr' instead.  This option is ignored for operations
other than translation.

   Acting like System V `tr' in this case breaks the relatively common
BSD idiom:

     tr -cs A-Za-z0-9 '\012'

because it converts only zero bytes (the first element in the
complement of SET1), rather than all non-alphanumerics, to newlines.


File: textutils.info,  Node: Squeezing,  Next: Warnings in tr,  Prev: Translating,  Up: tr invocation

Squeezing repeats and deleting
------------------------------

   When given just the `--delete' (`-d') option, `tr' removes any input
characters that are in SET1.

   When given just the `--squeeze-repeats' (`-s') option, `tr' replaces
each input sequence of a repeated character that is in SET1 with a
single occurrence of that character.

   When given both `--delete' and `--squeeze-repeats', `tr' first
performs any deletions using SET1, then squeezes repeats from any
remaining characters using SET2.

   The `--squeeze-repeats' option may also be used when translating, in
which case `tr' first performs translation, then squeezes repeats from
any remaining characters using SET2.

   Here are some examples to illustrate various combinations of options:

   * Remove all zero bytes:

          tr -d '\000'

   * Put all words on lines by themselves.  This converts all
     non-alphanumeric characters to newlines, then squeezes each string
     of repeated newlines into a single newline:

          tr -cs 'a-zA-Z0-9' '[\n*]'

   * Convert each sequence of repeated newlines to a single newline:

          tr -s '\n'

   * Find doubled occurrences of words in a document.  For example,
     people often write "the the" with the duplicated words separated
     by a newline.  The bourne shell script below works first by
     converting each sequence of punctuation and blank characters to a
     single newline.  That puts each "word" on a line by itself.  Next
     it maps all uppercase characters to lower case, and finally it
     runs `uniq' with the `-d' option to print out only the words that
     were adjacent duplicates.

          #!/bin/sh
          cat "$@" \
            | tr -s '[:punct:][:blank:]' '\n' \
            | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' \
            | uniq -d



File: textutils.info,  Node: Warnings in tr,  Prev: Squeezing,  Up: tr invocation

Warning messages
----------------

   Setting the environment variable `POSIXLY_CORRECT' turns off the
following warning and error messages, for strict compliance with
POSIX.2.  Otherwise, the following diagnostics are issued:

  1. When the `--delete' option is given but `--squeeze-repeats' is
     not, and SET2 is given, GNU `tr' by default prints a usage message
     and exits, because SET2 would not be used.  The POSIX
     specification says that SET2 must be ignored in this case.
     Silently ignoring arguments is a bad idea.

  2. When an ambiguous octal escape is given.  For example, `\400' is
     actually `\40' followed by the digit `0', because the value 400
     octal does not fit into a single byte.


   GNU `tr' does not provide complete BSD or System V compatibility.
For example, it is impossible to disable interpretation of the POSIX
constructs `[:alpha:]', `[=c=]', and `[c*10]'.  Also, GNU `tr' does not
delete zero bytes automatically, unlike traditional Unix versions,
which provide no way to preserve zero bytes.

`expand': Convert tabs to spaces
================================

   `expand' writes the contents of each given FILE, or standard input
if none are given or for a FILE of `-', to standard output, with tab
characters converted to the appropriate number of spaces.  Synopsis:

     expand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, `expand' converts all tabs to spaces.  It preserves
backspace characters in the output; they decrement the column count for
tab calculations.  The default action is equivalent to `-8' (set tabs
every 8 columns).

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-TAB1[,TAB2]...'
`-t TAB1[,TAB2]...'
`--tabs=TAB1[,TAB2]...'
     If only one tab stop is given, set the tabs TAB1 spaces apart
     (default is 8).  Otherwise, set the tabs at columns TAB1, TAB2,
     ... (numbered from 0), and replace any tabs beyond the last
     tabstop given with single spaces.  If the tabstops are specified
     with the `-t' or `--tabs' option, they can be separated by blanks
     as well as by commas.

`-i'
`--initial'
     Only convert initial tabs (those that precede all non-space or
     non-tab characters) on each line to spaces.


File: textutils.info,  Node: unexpand invocation,  Prev: expand invocation,  Up: Operating on characters

`unexpand': Convert spaces to tabs
==================================

   `unexpand' writes the contents of each given FILE, or standard input
if none are given or for a FILE of `-', to standard output, with
strings of two or more space or tab characters converted to as many
tabs as possible followed by as many spaces as are needed.  Synopsis:

     unexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   By default, `unexpand' converts only initial spaces and tabs (those
that precede all non space or tab characters) on each line.  It
preserves backspace characters in the output; they decrement the column
count for tab calculations.  By default, tabs are set at every 8th
column.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see *Note Common
options::.

`-TAB1[,TAB2]...'
`-t TAB1[,TAB2]...'
`--tabs=TAB1[,TAB2]...'
     If only one tab stop is given, set the tabs TAB1 spaces apart
     instead of the default 8.  Otherwise, set the tabs at columns
     TAB1, TAB2, ... (numbered from 0), and leave spaces and tabs
     beyond the tabstops given unchanged.  If the tabstops are specified
     with the `-t' or `--tabs' option, they can be separated by blanks
     as well as by commas.  This option implies the `-a' option.

`-a'
`--all'
     Convert all strings of two or more spaces or tabs, not just initial
     ones, to tabs.

Toolbox introduction
====================

   This month's column is only peripherally related to the GNU Project,
in that it describes a number of the GNU tools on your Linux system and
how they might be used.  What it's really about is the "Software Tools"
philosophy of program development and usage.

   The software tools philosophy was an important and integral concept
in the initial design and development of Unix (of which Linux and GNU
are essentially clones).  Unfortunately, in the modern day press of
Internetworking and flashy GUIs, it seems to have fallen by the
wayside.  This is a shame, since it provides a powerful mental model
for solving many kinds of problems.

   Many people carry a Swiss Army knife around in their pants pockets
(or purse).  A Swiss Army knife is a handy tool to have: it has several
knife blades, a screwdriver, tweezers, toothpick, nail file, corkscrew,
and perhaps a number of other things on it.  For the everyday, small
miscellaneous jobs where you need a simple, general purpose tool, it's
just the thing.

   On the other hand, an experienced carpenter doesn't build a house
using a Swiss Army knife.  Instead, he has a toolbox chock full of
specialized tools--a saw, a hammer, a screwdriver, a plane, and so on.
And he knows exactly when and where to use each tool; you won't catch
him hammering nails with the handle of his screwdriver.

   The Unix developers at Bell Labs were all professional programmers
and trained computer scientists.  They had found that while a
one-size-fits-all program might appeal to a user because there's only
one program to use, in practice such programs are

  a. difficult to write,

  b. difficult to maintain and debug, and

  c. difficult to extend to meet new situations.

   Instead, they felt that programs should be specialized tools.  In
short, each program "should do one thing well."  No more and no less.
Such programs are simpler to design, write, and get right--they only do
one thing.

   Furthermore, they found that with the right machinery for hooking
programs together, that the whole was greater than the sum of the
parts.  By combining several special purpose programs, you could
accomplish a specific task that none of the programs was designed for,
and accomplish it much more quickly and easily than if you had to write
a special purpose program.  We will see some (classic) examples of this
further on in the column.  (An important additional point was that, if
necessary, take a detour and build any software tools you may need
first, if you don't already have something appropriate in the toolbox.)

I/O redirection
===============

   Hopefully, you are familiar with the basics of I/O redirection in the
shell, in particular the concepts of "standard input," "standard
output," and "standard error".  Briefly, "standard input" is a data
source, where data comes from.  A program should not need to either
know or care if the data source is a disk file, a keyboard, a magnetic
tape, or even a punched card reader.  Similarly, "standard output" is a
data sink, where data goes to.  The program should neither know nor
care where this might be.  Programs that only read their standard
input, do something to the data, and then send it on, are called
"filters", by analogy to filters in a water pipeline.

   With the Unix shell, it's very easy to set up data pipelines:

     program_to_create_data | filter1 | .... | filterN > final.pretty.data

   We start out by creating the raw data; each filter applies some
successive transformation to the data, until by the time it comes out
of the pipeline, it is in the desired form.

   This is fine and good for standard input and standard output.  Where
does the standard error come in to play?  Well, think about `filter1' in
the pipeline above.  What happens if it encounters an error in the data
it sees?  If it writes an error message to standard output, it will just
disappear down the pipeline into `filter2''s input, and the user will
probably never see it.  So programs need a place where they can send
error messages so that the user will notice them.  This is standard
error, and it is usually connected to your console or window, even if
you have redirected standard output of your program away from your
screen.

   For filter programs to work together, the format of the data has to
be agreed upon.  The most straightforward and easiest format to use is
simply lines of text.  Unix data files are generally just streams of
bytes, with lines delimited by the ASCII LF (Line Feed) character,
conventionally called a "newline" in the Unix literature. (This is
`'\n'' if you're a C programmer.)  This is the format used by all the
traditional filtering programs.  (Many earlier operating systems had
elaborate facilities and special purpose programs for managing binary
data.  Unix has always shied away from such things, under the
philosophy that it's easiest to simply be able to view and edit your
data with a text editor.)

   OK, enough introduction. Let's take a look at some of the tools, and
then we'll see how to hook them together in interesting ways.   In the
following discussion, we will only present those command line options
that interest us.  As you should always do, double check your system
documentation for the full story.


File: textutils.info,  Node: The who command,  Next: The cut command,  Prev: I/O redirection,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

The `who' command
=================

   The first program is the `who' command.  By itself, it generates a
list of the users who are currently logged in.  Although I'm writing
this on a single-user system, we'll pretend that several people are
logged in:

     $ who
     arnold   console Jan 22 19:57
     miriam   ttyp0   Jan 23 14:19(:0.0)
     bill     ttyp1   Jan 21 09:32(:0.0)
     arnold   ttyp2   Jan 23 20:48(:0.0)

   Here, the `$' is the usual shell prompt, at which I typed `who'.
There are three people logged in, and I am logged in twice.  On
traditional Unix systems, user names are never more than eight
characters long.  This little bit of trivia will be useful later.  The
output of `who' is nice, but the data is not all that exciting.


File: textutils.info,  Node: The cut command,  Next: The sort command,  Prev: The who command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

The `cut' command
=================

   The next program we'll look at is the `cut' command.  This program
cuts out columns or fields of input data.  For example, we can tell it
to print just the login name and full name from the `/etc/passwd file'.
The `/etc/passwd' file has seven fields, separated by colons:

     arnold:xyzzy:2076:10:Arnold D. Robbins:/home/arnold:/bin/ksh

   To get the first and fifth fields, we would use cut like this:

     $ cut -d: -f1,5 /etc/passwd
     root:Operator
     ...
     arnold:Arnold D. Robbins
     miriam:Miriam A. Robbins
     ...

   With the `-c' option, `cut' will cut out specific characters (i.e.,
columns) in the input lines.  This command looks like it might be
useful for data filtering.


File: textutils.info,  Node: The sort command,  Next: The uniq command,  Prev: The cut command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

The `sort' command
==================

   Next we'll look at the `sort' command.  This is one of the most
powerful commands on a Unix-style system; one that you will often find
yourself using when setting up fancy data plumbing. The `sort' command
reads and sorts each file named on the command line.  It then merges
the sorted data and writes it to standard output.  It will read
standard input if no files are given on the command line (thus making
it into a filter).  The sort is based on the character collating
sequence or based on user-supplied ordering criteria.


File: textutils.info,  Node: The uniq command,  Next: Putting the tools together,  Prev: The sort command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

The `uniq' command
==================

   Finally (at least for now), we'll look at the `uniq' program.  When
sorting data, you will often end up with duplicate lines, lines that
are identical.  Usually, all you need is one instance of each line.
This is where `uniq' comes in. The `uniq' program reads its standard
input, which it expects to be sorted.  It only prints out one copy of
each duplicated line.  It does have several options.  Later on, we'll
use the `-c' option, which prints each unique line, preceded by a count
of the number of times that line occurred in the input.


File: textutils.info,  Node: Putting the tools together,  Prev: The uniq command,  Up: Opening the software toolbox

Putting the tools together
==========================

   Now, let's suppose this is a large BBS system with dozens of users
logged in.  The management wants the SysOp to write a program that will
generate a sorted list of logged in users.  Furthermore, even if a user
is logged in multiple times, his or her name should only show up in the
output once.

   The SysOp could sit down with the system documentation and write a C
program that did this. It would take perhaps a couple of hundred lines
of code and about two hours to write it, test it, and debug it.
However, knowing the software toolbox, the SysOp can instead start out
by generating just a list of logged on users:

     $ who | cut -c1-8
     arnold
     miriam
     bill
     arnold

   Next, sort the list:

     $ who | cut -c1-8 | sort
     arnold
     arnold
     bill
     miriam

   Finally, run the sorted list through `uniq', to weed out duplicates:

     $ who | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq
     arnold
     bill
     miriam

   The `sort' command actually has a `-u' option that does what `uniq'
does. However, `uniq' has other uses for which one cannot substitute
`sort -u'.

   The SysOp puts this pipeline into a shell script, and makes it
available for all the users on the system:

     # cat > /usr/local/bin/listusers
     who | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq
     ^D
     # chmod +x /usr/local/bin/listusers

   There are four major points to note here.  First, with just four
programs, on one command line, the SysOp was able to save about two
hours worth of work.  Furthermore, the shell pipeline is just about as
efficient as the C program would be, and it is much more efficient in
terms of programmer time.  People time is much more expensive than
computer time, and in our modern "there's never enough time to do
everything" society, saving two hours of programmer time is no mean
feat.

   Second, it is also important to emphasize that with the
_combination_ of the tools, it is possible to do a special purpose job
never imagined by the authors of the individual programs.

   Third, it is also valuable to build up your pipeline in stages, as
we did here.  This allows you to view the data at each stage in the
pipeline, which helps you acquire the confidence that you are indeed
using these tools correctly.

   Finally, by bundling the pipeline in a shell script, other users can
use your command, without having to remember the fancy plumbing you set
up for them. In terms of how you run them, shell scripts and compiled
programs are indistinguishable.

   After the previous warm-up exercise, we'll look at two additional,
more complicated pipelines.  For them, we need to introduce two more
tools.

   The first is the `tr' command, which stands for "transliterate."
The `tr' command works on a character-by-character basis, changing
characters. Normally it is used for things like mapping upper case to
lower case:

     $ echo ThIs ExAmPlE HaS MIXED case! | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'
     this example has mixed case!

   There are several options of interest:

`-c'
     work on the complement of the listed characters, i.e., operations
     apply to characters not in the given set

`-d'
     delete characters in the first set from the output

`-s'
     squeeze repeated characters in the output into just one character.

   We will be using all three options in a moment.

   The other command we'll look at is `comm'.  The `comm' command takes
two sorted input files as input data, and prints out the files' lines
in three columns.  The output columns are the data lines unique to the
first file, the data lines unique to the second file, and the data
lines that are common to both.  The `-1', `-2', and `-3' command line
options omit the respective columns. (This is non-intuitive and takes a
little getting used to.)  For example:

     $ cat f1
     11111
     22222
     33333
     44444
     $ cat f2
     00000
     22222
     33333
     55555
     $ comm f1 f2
             00000
     11111
                     22222
                     33333
     44444
             55555

   The single dash as a filename tells `comm' to read standard input
instead of a regular file.

   Now we're ready to build a fancy pipeline.  The first application is
a word frequency counter.  This helps an author determine if he or she
is over-using certain words.

   The first step is to change the case of all the letters in our input
file to one case.  "The" and "the" are the same word when doing
counting.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | ...

   The next step is to get rid of punctuation.  Quoted words and
unquoted words should be treated identically; it's easiest to just get
the punctuation out of the way.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' | ...

   The second `tr' command operates on the complement of the listed
characters, which are all the letters, the digits, the underscore, and
the blank.  The `\012' represents the newline character; it has to be
left alone.  (The ASCII tab character should also be included for good
measure in a production script.)

   At this point, we have data consisting of words separated by blank
space.  The words only contain alphanumeric characters (and the
underscore).  The next step is break the data apart so that we have one
word per line. This makes the counting operation much easier, as we
will see shortly.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | ...

   This command turns blanks into newlines.  The `-s' option squeezes
multiple newline characters in the output into just one.  This helps us
avoid blank lines. (The `>' is the shell's "secondary prompt."  This is
what the shell prints when it notices you haven't finished typing in
all of a command.)

   We now have data consisting of one word per line, no punctuation,
all one case.  We're ready to count each word:

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort | uniq -c | ...

   At this point, the data might look something like this:

       60 a
        2 able
        6 about
        1 above
        2 accomplish
        1 acquire
        1 actually
        2 additional

   The output is sorted by word, not by count!  What we want is the most
frequently used words first.  Fortunately, this is easy to accomplish,
with the help of two more `sort' options:

`-n'
     do a numeric sort, not a textual one

`-r'
     reverse the order of the sort

   The final pipeline looks like this:

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
      156 the
       60 a
       58 to
       51 of
       51 and
      ...

   Whew!  That's a lot to digest.  Yet, the same principles apply. With
six commands, on two lines (really one long one split for convenience),
we've created a program that does something interesting and useful, in
much less time than we could have written a C program to do the same
thing.

   A minor modification to the above pipeline can give us a simple
spelling checker!  To determine if you've spelled a word correctly, all
you have to do is look it up in a dictionary.  If it is not there, then
chances are that your spelling is incorrect.  So, we need a dictionary.
If you have the Slackware Linux distribution, you have the file
`/usr/lib/ispell/ispell.words', which is a sorted, 38,400 word
dictionary.

   Now, how to compare our file with the dictionary?  As before, we
generate a sorted list of words, one per line:

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort -u | ...

   Now, all we need is a list of words that are _not_ in the
dictionary.  Here is where the `comm' command comes in.

     $ tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' < whats.gnu | tr -cd '[A-Za-z0-9_ \012]' |
     > tr -s '[ ]' '\012' | sort -u |
     > comm -23 - /usr/lib/ispell/ispell.words

   The `-2' and `-3' options eliminate lines that are only in the
dictionary (the second file), and lines that are in both files.  Lines
only in the first file (standard input, our stream of words), are words
that are not in the dictionary.  These are likely candidates for
spelling errors.  This pipeline was the first cut at a production
spelling checker on Unix.

   There are some other tools that deserve brief mention.

`grep'
     search files for text that matches a regular expression

`egrep'
     like `grep', but with more powerful regular expressions

`wc'
     count lines, words, characters

`tee'
     a T-fitting for data pipes, copies data to files and to standard
     output

`sed'
     the stream editor, an advanced tool

`awk'
     a data manipulation language, another advanced tool

   The software tools philosophy also espoused the following bit of
advice: "Let someone else do the hard part." This means, take something
that gives you most of what you need, and then massage it the rest of
the way until it's in the form that you want.

   To summarize:

  1. Each program should do one thing well. No more, no less.

  2. Combining programs with appropriate plumbing leads to results where
     the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  It also leads to
     novel uses of programs that the authors might never have imagined.

  3. Programs should never print extraneous header or trailer data,
     since these could get sent on down a pipeline. (A point we didn't
     mention earlier.)

  4. Let someone else do the hard part.

  5. Know your toolbox! Use each program appropriately. If you don't
     have an appropriate tool, build one.

   As of this writing, all the programs we've discussed are available
via anonymous `ftp' from `prep.ai.mit.edu' as
`/pub/gnu/textutils-1.9.tar.gz'.(1)

   None of what I have presented in this column is new. The Software
Tools philosophy was first introduced in the book `Software Tools', by
Brian Kernighan and P.J. Plauger (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-03669-X).
This book showed how to write and use software tools.   It was written
in 1976, using a preprocessor for FORTRAN named `ratfor' (RATional
FORtran).  At the time, C was not as ubiquitous as it is now; FORTRAN
was.  The last chapter presented a `ratfor' to FORTRAN processor,
written in `ratfor'. `ratfor' looks an awful lot like C; if you know C,
you won't have any problem following the code.

   In 1981, the book was updated and made available as `Software Tools
in Pascal' (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-10342-7).  Both books remain in
print, and are well worth reading if you're a programmer.  They
certainly made a major change in how I view programming.

   Initially, the programs in both books were available (on 9-track
tape) from Addison-Wesley.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case,
although you might be able to find copies floating around the Internet.
For a number of years, there was an active Software Tools Users Group,
whose members had ported the original `ratfor' programs to essentially
every computer system with a FORTRAN compiler.  The popularity of the
group waned in the middle '80s as Unix began to spread beyond
universities.

   With the current proliferation of GNU code and other clones of Unix
programs, these programs now receive little attention; modern C
versions are much more efficient and do more than these programs do.
Nevertheless, as exposition of good programming style, and evangelism
for a still-valuable philosophy, these books are unparalleled, and I
recommend them highly.

   Acknowledgment: I would like to express my gratitude to Brian
Kernighan of Bell Labs, the original Software Toolsmith, for reviewing
this column.
