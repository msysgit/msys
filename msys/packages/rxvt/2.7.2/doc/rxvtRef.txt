menuBar

The exact syntax used is almost solidified. 
In the menus, DON'T try to use menuBar commands that add or remove a
menuBar.

Note that in all of the commands, the /path/ cannot be omitted:
use ./ to specify a menu relative to the current menu.

Overview of menuBar operation

For the menuBar XTerm escape sequence ESC ] 10; Pt BEL, the
syntax of Pt can be used for a variety of tasks:

    o Commands
    o Adding and accessing menus
    o Removing menus
    o Quick Arrows
    o Command Summary

At the top level is the current menuBar which is a member of a circular
linked-list of other such menuBars.

The menuBar acts as a parent for the various drop-down menus, which in turn,
may have labels, separator lines, menuItems and subMenus.

The menuItems are the useful bits: you can use them to mimic keyboard input
or even to send text or escape sequences back to rxvt.

The menuBar syntax is intended to provide a simple yet robust method of
constructing and manipulating menus and navigating through the menuBars.

The first step is to use the tag [menu:name] which creates the
menuBar called name and allows access.
You may now add or remove menus,
subMenus, and menuItems. Finally, use the tag [done] to set the menuBar
access as readonly to prevent accidental corruption of the menus.
To re-access the current menuBar for alterations, use the tag [menu],
make the alterations and then use [done]

Commands

    o [menu:name]
        access the named menuBar for creation or alteration. If a new menuBar
	is created, it is called name (max of 15 chars) and the current
	menuBar is pushed onto the stack

    o [menu]
        access the current menuBar for alteration

    o [title:string]
        set the current menuBar's title to string, which may contain the
	following format specifiers: 
        %% : literal % character 
        %n : rxvt name (as per the -name command-line option) 
        %v : rxvt version

    o [done]
        set menuBar access as readonly. 
        End-of-file tag for [read:file] operations.

    o [read:file]
        read menu commands directly from file (extension ".menu" will be
	appended if required.) Start reading at a line with [menu] or
	[menu:name and continuing until [done] is encountered.

	Blank and comment lines (starting with #) are ignored.
	Actually, since any invalid menu commands are also ignored, almost
	anything could be construed as a comment line, but this may be
	tightened up in the future ... so don't count on it!.

    o [read:file;name]
        The same as [read:file], but start reading at a line with
	[menu:name] and continuing until [done:name] or
	[done] is encountered.

    o [dump]
        dump all menuBars to the file /tmp/rxvt-PID in a format suitable
	for later rereading.

    o [rm:name]
      [rm] [rm:]
      [rm*] [rm:*]
        remove the named menuBar 
        remove the current menuBar 
        remove all menuBars

    o [swap]
        swap the top two menuBars

    o [prev]
      [next]
        access the previous or next menuBar

    o [show]
      [hide]
        control display of the menuBar ... just like
	ESC[?10 h/l

    o [pixmap:name]
      [pixmap:name;scaling]
        set the background pixmap globally ... just like
	ESC]20; Pt BEL

	A Future implementation may make this local to the menubar

    o [:command:]
        ignore the menu readonly status and issue a command to
	Add/Modify or Remove a menu or
	menuitem or change the Quick Arrows; a useful
	shortcut for setting the quick arrows from a menuBar.

Adding and accessing menus

The following commands may also be + prefixed.

    o /
      ./
      ../
      ../../
        access menuBar top level 
        access current menu level 
        access parent menu (1 level up) 
        access parent menu (multiple levels up)
    o /path/menu
        add/access menu
    o /path/menu/*
        add/access menu and clear it if it exists
    o /path/{-}
        add separator
    o /path/{item}
        add item as a label
    o /path/{item} action
        add/alter menuitem with an associated action
    o /path/{item}{right-text}
        add/alter menuitem with right-text as the right-justified
	text and as the associated action
    o /path/{item}{rtext} action
        add/alter menuitem with an associated action and with
	rtext as the right-justified text.

    o Special characters in action must be backslash-escaped:
        \a \b \E \e \n \r \t \octal
    o or in control-character notation:
        ^@, ^A .. ^Z .. ^_, ^?

To send a string starting with a NUL (^@) character to the program,
start action with a pair of NUL characters (^@^@), the first of
which will be stripped off and the balance directed to the program.
Otherwise if action begins with NUL followed by non-NUL
characters, the leading NUL is stripped off and the balance is sent back
to rxvt.

As a convenience for the many Emacs-type editors, action may start
with M- (eg, M-$ is equivalent to \E$) and a CR will be
appended if missed from M-x commands.

As a convenience for issuing XTerm ESC] sequences from a menubar
(or quick arrow), a BEL (^G) will be appended if needed.

    o For example,
        M-xapropos is equivalent to \Exapropos\r
    o and
        \E]10;mona;100 is equivalent to \E]10;mona;100\a

The option {right-rtext} will be right-justified.  In the absence of
a specified action, this text will be used as the action as well.

    o For example,
        /File/{Open}{^X^F} is equivalent to /File/{Open}{^X^F} ^X^F

The left label is necessary, since it's used for matching,
but implicitly hiding the left label (by using same name for both left
and right labels), or explicitly hiding the left label (by preceeding
it with a dot), makes it possible to have right-justified text only.

    o For example,
        /File/{Open}{Open} Open-File-Action
    o or hiding it
        /File/{.anylabel}{Open} Open-File-Action

Removing menus

    o -/*
      -/pathmenu
      -/path{item}
      -/path{-}
        remove all menus from the menuBar, the same as [clear]
        remove menu 
        remove item 
        remove separator
    o -/path/menu/*
        remove all items, separators and submenus from menu

Quick Arrows

The menus also provide a hook for quick arrows to provide easier user
access. If nothing has been explicitly set, the default is to emulate the
curror keys. The syntax permits each arrow to be altered individually or
all four at once without re-entering their common beginning/end text. For
example, to explicitly associate cursor actions with the arrows, any of
the following forms could be used:

    o <r>Right
      <l>Left
      <u>Up
      <d>Down
        Define actions for the respective arrow buttons
    o <b>Begin
      <e>End
        Define common beginning/end parts for quick arrows which used
	in conjunction with the above <r> <l> <u> <d> constructs

    o For example, define arrows individually,
        <u>\E[A 
        <d>\E[B 
        <r>\E[C 
        <l>\E[D
    o or all at once
        <u>\E[A<d>\E[B<r>\E[C<l>\E[D
    o or more compactly (factoring out common parts)
        <b>\E[<u>A<d>B<r>C<l>D

XPM

For the XPM XTerm escape sequence ESC ] 20; Pt BEL then value of
Pt can be the name of the background pixmap followed by a sequence of
scaling/positioning commands separated by semi-colons. The scaling/positioning
commands are as follows:

    o query scale/position
        ?

    o change scale and position
        WxH+X+Y
        WxH+X (== WxH+X+X)
        WxH (same as WxH+50+50)
        W+X+Y (same as WxW+X+Y)
        W+X (same as WxW+X+X)
        W (same as WxW+50+50)

    o change position (absolute)
        =+X+Y
        =+X (same as =+X+Y)

    o change position (relative)
        +X+Y
        +X (same as +X+Y)

    o rescale (relative)
        Wx0 -> W *= (W/100)
        0xH -> H *= (H/100)

For example:

    o \E]20;funky\a
        load funky.xpm as a tiled image

    o \E]20;mona;100\a
        load mona.xpm with a scaling of 100%

    o \E]20;;200;?\a
        rescale the current pixmap to 200% and display the image geometry in the title

Mouse Reporting

    o ESC [ M <b> <x> <y>
        report mouse position

The lower 2 bits of <b> indicate the button:

    o Button = (<b> - SPACE) & 3
        0 = Button1 pressed 
        1 = Button2 pressed 
        2 = Button3 pressed 
        3 = button released (X11 mouse report)

The upper bits of <b> indicate the modifiers when the button was
pressed and are added together (X11 mouse report only):

    o State = (<b> - SPACE) & 60
        4 = Shift 
        8 = Meta 
        16 = Control 
        32 = Double Click (Rxvt extension) 
        Col = <x> - SPACE 
        Row = <y> - SPACE

    o ESC G Q
        query if graphics are available 
        returns: ESC G 0 no graphics available 
        returns: ESC G 1 graphics available (colour only)

    o ESC G W <;x>;<y>;<w>;<h>:
        create window

    o ESC G C <id>
        clear window

    o ESC G G <it>:
        query window 
        returns: ESC G <id> <x> <y> <w> <h> <fw> <fh> <nw> <nh>

    o ESC G L <id>
      ESC G P <id>
      ESC G F <id>
        start point 
        start line 
        start fill

    o ;<x>;<y>
        extend point/line/fill

    o ESC G T <id>;<x>;<y>;<mode>;<len>:<text>

Key Codes

Note: Shift + F1-F10 generates F11-F20

For the keypad, use Shift to temporarily override Application-Keypad
setting use Num_Lock to toggle Application-Keypad setting if Num_Lock
is off, escape sequences toggle Application-Keypad setting.
Also note that values of Home, End, Delete may have been compiled
differently on your system.
