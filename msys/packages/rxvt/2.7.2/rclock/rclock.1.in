the window manager.

.SH "REMINDERS"
The
.B "~/.rclock"
file lists the messages to display and/or the programs to run at
specified times and dates.
At the specified time,
.B rclock
will pop-up a window in the center of the screen to display the
message or will simply run the scheduled program.
.B
rclock will reads the
.B "~/.rclock"
file at startup, and every 10 minutes (to look for changes) and after
a message window has been dismissed (to find the next appointment).

An entry in
.B "~/.rclock"
may be one of two formats (blank and comment lines will be ignored):
.sp
.nf
.B hh:mm  [dd]  MM/DD/YY message[; program]
or
.B [hh:mm  [dd]  MM/DD/YY [message]]; program
.sp
.BR hh " \- hour (0-23; * = current)"
.BR mm " \- minute (0-59; * = 0)"
.BR dd " \- days-of-week (some/all/none of umtwrfs; * = all)"
.BR MM " \- month (1-12; * = current)"
.BR DD " \- day of month (1-31; * = current)"
.BR YY " \- year (0-99 or 1900-????; * = current)"
.BR message " \- message to display"
.BR program " \- program to execute"
.fi
.sp
The days-of-the-week use the following abbreviations:
.BR u =Sunday,
.BR m =Monday,
.BR t =Tuesday,
.BR w =Wednesday,
.BR r =Thursday,
.BR f =Friday,
.BR s =Saturday,
.BR * =all.
.sp
If
.B message
is empty and
.B program
has been specified, it is executed without a dialog box.
If time/date are also not specified,
.B program
is executed on start-up.
Note
.B message
may contain escape values (\\n: newline, \\;: semicolon).

Here's a silly example file that shows some of the permissible
constructs:
.nf
.sp

# cron functions

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B rclock
uses the environment variable
.B MAIL
to determine the location of the user's mail spool file.

.SH BUGS
.B rclock
is not very smart about dealing with errors encountered while reading the
.B "~/.rclock"
file.
Each reminder must be a single line not exceeding 255 characters.
Reminder windows are sometimes not redrawn (left blank) when raised or
uncovered.
