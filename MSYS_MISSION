The mission or goal of MSYS is to provide a POSIX environment for developing
MinGW ports and code.  The MSYS developers have taken the Cygwin source and
modified it to fit the needs for MinGW and MSYS.  MSYS in it's own right is
a runtime library and could be used instead of MSVCRT, CRTDLL or even CYGWIN.
However, just like CYGWIN you can't mix two differing runtimes.
