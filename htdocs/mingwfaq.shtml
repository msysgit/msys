      <h3><a name="faq-what">What is MinGW?</a></h3>

      <p>MinGW ("Minimalistic GNU
         for Windows") refers to a set of runtime headers,
         used in building a compiler system based on the
         GNU GCC and binutils projects. It compiles and
         links code to be run on Win32 platforms...
         providing C, C++ and Fortran compilers plus other
         related tools. If you see references to "mingw32"
         instead of "MinGW", they are referring to the
         same compiler system. The project's name changed
         from mingw32 to MinGW is to prevent the
         implication that MinGW will only works on 32 bit
         systems (as 64 and higher bit machines become
         more common, MinGW will evolve to work with
         them). MinGW uses the Microsoft runtime
         libraries, distributed with the Windows operating
         system. Unlike other ports of GCC to Windows, the
         runtime libraries are not distributed using Gnu's
         General Public License (GPL). You, therefore, do
         not have to distribute your source code with your
         programs unless, of course, you use a GPL library
         in your programs..</p> 

      <p>Check out the
         <a href="history.shtml">project history</a>
         for the interesting story of How MinGW
         Began.</p>

      <h3><a name="faq-msys">What is MSYS?</a></h3>

      <p>MSYS or Minimal SYStem is a
         POSIX and Bourne shell environment use with
         MinGW. It provides a hand picked set of tools to
         allow a typical configuration script with Bourne
         syntax to execute. This allows most of the GNU
         packages to create a Makefile just from executing
         the typical configure script which can then be
         used to build the package using the native MinGW
         version of GCC.</p>

      <p>The POSIX layer used by
         MSYS is a fork of the 1.3.3 version of
         <a href= "http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">Cygwin</a>
         .  Cygwin is a full POSIX layer and UNIX-like
         environment for Win32 providing both server and
         client utilites.</p>

      <p>For more MSYS-specific information, please see
         the <a href="msys.shtml">MSYS section</a> of this
         website.</p>

      <h3><a name="faq-w32api">What is w32api?</a></h3>

      <p>The w32api is the package
         of headers and import libraries to support the
         Win32 Application Programming Interface as
         created by Microsoft. The MinGW development team
         are the current maintainers of the w32api since
         without that package Windows Programming would
         not be possible. The package was created by
         Anders Norlander and it's license is also
         non-restrictive. For more information see the
         file 
         <a href= "http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/mingw/w32api/README.w32api?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup"> README.w32api</a>

      <h3><a name="faq-where">Where can I get MinGW?</a></h3>

      <p>Initially, MinGW was an
         assortment of individual packages... the MinGW
         runtime, various applications built using that
         runtime (gcc, ld, etc.), and other useful
         components (the w32api headers needed to code for
         the Win32 API). Developers "rolled their own"
         MinGW environments by downloading the latest
         versions of each individual package needed. This
         was necessary given the dynamic nature of early
         package versions (updates being posted
         constantly)... but was oftentimes confusing for
         newbies, and made it difficult for
         application/library vendors to design products
         that build with a "standard" MinGW
         environment.</p>

      <p>Therefore, around mid-2001
         when development had matured and updates were not
         being packaged as rapidly, the decision was made
         to create a single-file distribution of the
         standard MinGW environment. This single archive
         contains the files from each component package,
         bundled and ready to extract. The individual
         component packages are still available for
         download... if a particular package is updated in
         between releases of the overall distribution,
         it's possible to simply drop the newer package in
         place over a distribution install.</p>

      <p>MinGW files are hosted by
         SourceForge. For more information and links to

      <h3><a name="faq-license">How is MinGW licensed?</a></h3>

      <p>When Colin Peters
         released the MinGW runtime he placed the source
         into the public domain. No one owns a copyright
         (C) to the source because of this. You as a
         software manufacturer are free to use the MinGW
         runtime in your proprietary and OpenSource
         software as you see fit. The only thing you can't
         do is to claim ownership of the source and use
         Colin Peters' name, the MinGW name or the name of
         any of it's contributors in endorsement of any
         product.</p>

      <p>For those interested in
         the actual legal details and technical points
         regarding copyright of the MinGW compiler system,
         copyright information is included in the headers
         and the source files of the compiler distribution
         package. The following also applies:</p>

         <ul>

          <li>The MinGW basic runtime system, which is
              basically the glue to the underlying operating
              system, is completely in the public domain. The
              runtime system includes MinGW headers (such as
              stdio.h), libraries (such as libmingw32.a) and
              import libraries for CRTDLL/MSVCRT.</li>

          <li>W32API, which consists of the headers and
              import libraries related to WIN32 API access,
              is released under</li>

              . The copyright agreement states
              no restrictions are placed on programs or
              object files compiled with the library.</li>

          <li>Mingw development tools, which include
              compilers, linkers, other tools in the bin
              directory, etc., are released under the GNU

          <li>Profiled code, which is code compiled and
              linked with the <code>-pg</code> option for
              runtime profiling, also falls under the GNU

      <h3><a name="faq-usingolderversions">Can I use older versions?</a></h3>

      <p>It's highly recommended that you use the
         latest version of MinGW. Older versions may have
         more bugs and can be more difficult to install or
         use than the latest version. Please be sure that
         you have downloaded and are working with the
         latest version, especially if you are having any
         difficulties with installation or use. If you are
         not sure of your version, you can type <code>gcc
         --version</code> to find out what you are
         using.</p>

      <h3><a name="faq-configure">How do I execute configure scripts?</a></h3>

      <p>Applications using a
         UNIX-style build process will typically require a
         shell environment and set of POSIX tools, for
         executing configure scripts and building the
         application. The Cygwin environment was once the
         only choice available to fill this role, although
         recently the MSYS environment was released to
         offer MinGW developers a more lightweight
         alternative. The use of both these environments
         with MinGW is described in more detail
         below.</p>

      <h3><a name="faq-usingwithmsys">How do I use MinGW with MSYS?</a></h3>

      <p>It's easy to
         configure an MSYS environment for MinGW useage,
         since there is no overlap in functionality to
         contend with (as there is with Cygwin). Simply
         decompress the contents of each archive into
         directories of your choosing, and add the MinGW
         "/bin" subdirectory to your PATH (either within
         MSYS's " /etc/profile" or in your overall system
         PATH). There is no need to add MSYS's "/bin" to
         your system PATH.</p>

      <p>You may install
         the MinGW and MSYS packages anywhere on your
         filesystem, even nesting one within the other
         (creating a " mingw" subdirectory beneath your
         "msys" directory, for instance). However, it is
         important to remember that NO executables other
         than what ships with MSYS should be placed in the
         MSYS " bin" subdirectory. Therefore, do not
         attempt to "merge" the two packages.</p>

      <h3><a name="faq-usingwithcygwin">How do I use MinGW with Cygwin?</a></h3>

      <p>For those who
         would like to use the Cygwin environment for
         development, yet generate non-Cygwin-dependant
         executables, a much easier option to
         "-mno-cygwin" does exist. Simply install Cygwin
         and the MinGW distribution in seperate
         directories (i.e. "C:\CYGWIN" and "C:\MINGW"),
         and make sure that the "/bin" subdirectory
         beneath your MinGW installation comes before
         Cygwin's "/bin" subdirectory in your PATH
         environment variable (i.e.
         "PATH=%PATH%;C:\MINGW\BIN;C:\CYGWIN\BIN"). This
         will allow you access to all the UNIX tools you
         want, while ensuring that the instance of GCC
         used is the MinGW version.</p>

      <p>Bear in mind
         that within the "/etc/profile" file, Cygwin by
         default places "/usr/local/bin", "/usr/bin", and
         "/bin" ahead of your system-level PATH.
         Therefore, it is not enough to have the MinGW's
         "/bin" ahead of Cygwin in your Windows path... it
         must also be set to come first within the Cygwin
         environment (either by modifying "/etc/profile"
         or setting it manually).</p>

      <h3><a name="faq-comsupport">Is support provided for COM?</a></h3> 

      <p>MinGW has some
         support for COM programs. Programmers have had
         much better luck writing COM applications in C
         than C++. Work is in progress to improve support.
         Check the MinGW mailing list archives for more
         details on COM and more links to example

      <h3><a name="faq-msvcdll">How can an MSVC program call a MinGW DLL, and vice versa?</a></h3>

      <p>Assume we have a
         testdll.h, testdll.c, and testmain.c. In the
         first case, we will compile testdll.c with MinGW,
         and let the MSVC-compiled testmain call it. You
         should use</p>

         <blockquote>
          <code>gcc -shared -o
          testdll.dll testdll.c \<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          -Wl,--output-def,testdll.def,--out-implib,libtestdll.a</code>
         </blockquote> to produce
         the DLL and DEF files. MSVC cannot use the MinGW
         library, but since you have already the DEF file
         you may easily produce one by the Microsoft
         <code>LIB</code> tool:

         <blockquote>
          <code>lib /machine:i386
          /def:testdll.def</code>
         </blockquote>

      <p>Once you have
         testdll.lib, it is trivial to produce the
         executable with MSVC:</p>

         <blockquote>
          <code>cl testmain.c
          testdll.lib</code>
         </blockquote> 

      <p>Now for MinGW programs
         calling an MSVC DLL. We have two methods. One way
         is to specify the LIB files directly on the
         command line <i>after</i> the main program. For
         example, after</p>

         <blockquote>
          <code>cl /LD
          testdll.c</code>
         </blockquote> use 

         <blockquote>
          <code>gcc -o testmain
          testmain.c testdll.lib</code>
         </blockquote>

      <p>The other way is to produce the .a files for GCC. For
         <code>__cdecl</code> functions (in most cases),
         it is simple: you only need to apply the
         <code>reimp</code> tool from Anders Norlander
         (since his web site is no longer available, you
         may choose to download
         <a href= "http://mywebpage.netscape.com/yongweiwu/reimp_new.zip"> here</a> 
         a version enhanced by Jose Fonseca):</p>

         <blockquote>
          <code>reimp testdll.lib</code><br>
           <code>gcc -o testmain testmain.c -L.
          -ltestdll</code>
         </blockquote>

      <p>However, for <code>__stdcall</code> functions,
         the above method does not work. For MSVC will
         prefix an underscore to <code>__stdcall</code>
         functions while MinGW will not. The right way is
         to produce the DEF file using the
         <code>pexports</code> tool from 
         <a href="http://www.is.lg.ua/%7Epaul/devel/binutils.html"> http://www.is.lg.ua/~paul/devel/binutils.html</a>
         and filter off the first underscore by
         <code>sed</code>:</p>

         <blockquote>
          <code>pexports testdll.dll | sed "s/^_//" &gt;
          testdll.def</code>
         </blockquote>Then, when using
         <code>dlltool</code> to produce the import
         library, add `<code>-U</code>' to the command
         line: 

         <blockquote>
          <code>dlltool -U -d testdll.def -l
          libtestdll.a</code>
         </blockquote>And now, you can proceed in the
         usual way: 

         <blockquote>
          <code>gcc -o testmain testmain.c -L.
          -ltestdll</code>
         </blockquote>Hooray, we got it.

         compiling MS-Windows executables from within a
         Linux environment, or vice-versa). As GCC is
         found on literally dozens of platforms, it is
         theoretically possible to use the MinGW runtime
         in creating a cross-compilation development
         environment in many scenerios.</p>

         use. You'll have to update the packages. This

      <h3><a name="faq-mingw32-gcc.exe">What's the difference between gcc.exe and mingw32-gcc.exe?</a></h3>

      <p>The mingw32-gcc,
         mingw32-g++, etc. binaries exist as an aid to
         cross development. They are created in a typical
         build of gcc. They are therefore distributed as
         the maintainers of GCC meant them to be. The
         gcc.exe indicates that the binary produces
         binaries for a target equal to the build, while
         the mingw32-gcc binary produces binaries to be
         executed on the mingw32 target.</p>

      <h3><a name="faq-mingw32-make.exe">Why is make named mingw32-make.exe?</a></h3>

      <p>The "native"
         (i.e.: MSVCRT dependent) port of make is lacking
         in some functionality and has modified
         functionality due to the lack of POSIX on Win32.
         There also exists a version of make in the MSYS
         distribution that is dependent on the MSYS
         runtime. This port operates more as make was
         intended to operate and gives less headaches
         during execution. Based on this, the MinGW
         developers/maintainers/packagers decided it would
         be best to rename the native version so that both
         the "native" version and the MSYS version could
         be present at the same time without file name
         collision.</p>
