  <h3>What is MinGW?</h3>
  <p>
     MinGW is an acronym for "Minimalist GNU for Windows".  The name was coined
     by Colin Peters who created headers and import definitions for Microsoft's
     crtdll C runtime in an effort to remove the dependancy of the Cygwin1.dll
     from applications built by Cygwin's GCC.  It is that set of files that
     constitute what MinGW is and is interchangeably refered to as the MinGW 
     runtime.  Colin maintains a website about MinGW at 
     <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/6162/gcc.html" target="_nw">
     http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Towers/6162/gcc.html</a> which lists some
     interesting details you won't find here.  Other history details can be
     found on our <a href="history.shtml">history</a> page.
  </p>
  <p>
     The MinGW runtime was eventually used to create a port of GCC and binutils
     to the Win32 platform and to create native binaries for it.  These ports
     have commonly been mistaken for MinGW itself.  In reality these ports are
     just using MinGW.  The MinGW team will continue to port these utilities
     as new releases of the utilities are created.  It is our hope that the
     source code base for these utilities incorporate our work so that we don't
     have to continually apply our patches.  And many such patches have
     already been applied as can be evidenced by the ChangeLog of the source
     packages.

     Today MinGW is a project of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">SourceForge.net</a>.
     We have a few developers working in their spare time with no corporate
     funding in the project.  If you would like to volunteer please let us know
     via email to the <a href="mailto:mingw-users@sourceforge.net">MinGW mail list</a>
