      <h1>MinGW - Home</h1>

      <p><span class="bold">MinGW:</span> A collection of freely available
      and freely distributable Windows specific header files and import
      libraries combined with GNU toolsets that allow one to produce native
      Windows programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party C runtime DLLs.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">MSYS:</span> A contraction of "Minimal SYStem",
      MSYS is a POSIX-like command line interpreter system, (CLI), offered
      as an alternative to the Windows Command Prompt, (a.k.a. cmd.exe).
      Conceived to facilitate the execution of the POSIX style build scripts
      commonly provided by Open Source projects, and to interpret the Makefiles
      which they generate, its CLI interprets the Bourne Shell command language,
      in order to execute the commands commonly invoked by such scripts.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">Mailing Lists:</span> We have several <a href=
