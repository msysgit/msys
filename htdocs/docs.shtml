         <h3>How to create a console application</h3>
           <p>
              Here's an example.  The following is a code sample for a simple C program.  Cut 
              and paste it into a file named hello.c to try it out.
           </p>
           <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  printf ("Hello\n");
  return (0);
}
           </pre>  
           If you want to create a console mode executable hello.exe
           from a c file called hello.c, try the following:
           <pre>
gcc -c hello.c
           </pre>
           This compiles hello.c into an object file, hello.o
           <pre>
gcc -o hello hello.o
           </pre>
           This creates an executable hello.exe from hello.o. Alternatively, you can compile 
           and link in one step using:
           <pre>
gcc -o hello hello.c 
           </pre>
           <p>
              The following is a code sample for a simple C++ program.  Cut and paste it into 
              a file named hello.cpp to try it out.
           </p>
           <pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 return (0);
}
           </pre>
           <p>
              For the C++ program, use the following to compile and link:
           </p>
           <pre>
g++ -c hello.cpp
g++ -o hello hello.o
           </pre>

               <h3>How to create a windows application?</h3>
               <p>
                  Here's an example.  The following is a code sample for a simple
                  Windows program.  Cut and paste it into a file named hello.c to try it out.
               </p>
               <pre>
   #include &lt;windows.h&gt;

   int WINAPI WinMain (HINSTANCE hInstance, 
                        HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, 
                        PSTR szCmdLine, 
                        int iCmdShow) 
   {
      MessageBox (NULL, "Hello", "Hello Demo", MB_OK);
      return (0);
   }
               </pre>
               <p>
                  If you want to create a Windows executable hello.exe, from a c file called 
                  hello.c, try the following:
               </p>
               <pre>
   gcc -c hello.c
               </pre>
               This compiles hello.c into an object file, hello.o
               <pre>
   gcc -o hello hello.o -mwindows
               </pre>
               This creates an executable hello.exe from hello.o
               The <code>-mwindows</code> switch is needed to create Windows executables
               instead of console applications.  It assures the appropriate Windows libraries
               are linked in for you.  To get a console screen along with a standard windows 
               application, add the <code>-mconsole</code> flag as well as <code>-mwindows</code>.
               <p>
                  If you have resources from a resource file (.rc) that also need
                  to be added to your executable, you'll need to compile the resource
                  file as well as your other source files and include the compiled resources
                  when linking to create the executable.  Here's an example that shows how to
                  compile and link in a resource file named resfile.rc.
               </p>
               <pre>
   windres -o resfile.o resfile.rc
   gcc -o hello hello.o resfile.o -mwindows
               </pre>


               <h3>How to create a dll</h3>
               <p>
                  Here's an example.  Cut and paste the following into a file
                  named dllfct.h:
               </p>
               <pre>
   #ifdef BUILD_DLL
   // the dll exports
   #define EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
   #else
   // the exe imports
   #define EXPORT __declspec(dllimport)
   #endif

   // function to be imported/exported
   EXPORT void tstfunc (void);
               </pre>
               <p>
                  Cut and paste the following into a file named dllfct.c:
               </p>
               <pre>
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   #include "dllfct.h"

   EXPORT void tstfunc (void)
   {
      printf ("Hello\n");
   }
               </pre>
               <p>
                  Cut and paste the following into a file named hello.c:
               </p>
               <pre>
   #include "dllfct.h"

   int main ()
   {
      tstfunc ();
      return (0);
   }
               </pre>
               <p>
                  To create the dll and an executable that uses it, try the following:
               </p>
               <pre>
   gcc -c hello.c
   gcc -c -DBUILD_DLL dllfct.c
   gcc -shared -o tst.dll -Wl,--out-implib,libtstdll.a dllfct.o
   gcc -o hello.exe hello.o -L./ -ltstdll
               </pre>
               <p>
                  For more information on dlls, see
                  <a href="http://www.nanotech.wisc.edu/%7Ekhan/software/gnu-win32/dllhelpers.html">

               <h3>How to create a def file for a dll</h3>
               <p>
                  There are several methods that can be tried in order to 
		  create a definition file (.def) when one is not supplied.
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     One option is the tool, pexports which is provided in the
		     MinGW Utilities package, mingw-utils.  See the Downloads
		     page for the Current version.  If your dll has functions 
		     that use the Pascal calling convention, you'll need to use
		     the <code>-o</code> option.
                  </li>      
                  <li>
                     Another option is the tool,
                     impdef.
                     More instructions on how to create def files from dlls, a 
		     copy of impdef and more information on how to use it are 
		     available at Colin Peters' site.
                     See the <a href="#tutorials">Tutorials</a> section.
                     Other compilers may also supply versions of the impdef 
		     program that can be used to create a .def file which will 
		     work with any compiler.  If you have another version of 
		     impdef from another compiler, you may wish to try it.
                     Some handle the Pascal calling convention better than 
		     others.  Borland has a version of impdef and other 
		     compiler utilities available for download at their
                     Borland Community web site.  Their Borland C++ version 
		     5.5 compiler includes several utilities to help convert 
		     between standard formats, their formats and Microsoft's
                     formats.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Another option is to use nm which comes with the MinGW distribution.
                     This option will not work for all dlls.  Problems may occur if the dll is stripped or
                     compiled as 16 bit.  To use this technique, you'll need to filter the output from nm to
                     create a def file.  This can be done by hand in an editor or automated using tools like
                     Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) or grep (global regular expression print)
                     and sed (stream editor).  Even with the automated methods, you may have to
                     make some changes by hand if the Pascal calling convention is used by the dll.
                     See Colin Peters' site for more details on this case.
                     (Versions of sed and grep are available from various sites
                     including archives that host gnuish MSDOS and archives such as Virtually Un*x that contain
                     Win32 ports of common Unix tools and from the self-hosting MinGW port distribution.  The
                     ActiveState version of Perl works well on Win32 platforms.)
                     Here are examples of possible filtering techniques.
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <p>
                              This example uses grep and sed.  If you have a dll named file.dll that you wish 
                              to create a def file for named file.def, try the following:
                           </p>
                           <pre> 
   echo EXPORTS &gt; file.def
   nm file.dll | grep ' T _' | sed 's/.* T _//' &gt;&gt; file.def
                           </pre>
                           <p>
                              To create a library file named file.a from the dll and def file, type:
                           </p>
                           <pre>
   dlltool --def file.def --dllname file.dll --output-lib file.a
                           </pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>
                              This example uses Perl.  Copy the following Perl script
                              to a file called dll.pl and use it:
                           </p>
                           <pre>
   open (OUTFILE,"&gt;dll.def");
   print OUTFILE "EXPORTS\n";
   open (INFILE,"dll.fil");
   while(&lt;INFILE&gt;)
   {
      if ($_ =~ /T _/)
      {
         $line = $_;
         $line =~ s/.* T _//;
         print OUTFILE $line;
      }
   }
   close (INFILE);
   close (OUTFILE);
                           </pre>
                           <p>
                              If you have a dll file named file.dll.  At the command line, type:
                           </p>
                           <pre>
   nm file.dll &gt; dll.fil
   perl dll.pl
                           </pre>
                           <p>
                              A def file named dll.def will be created.  You can rename this
                              as needed.  You'll also probably want to delete dll.fil when you're finished
                              with this process.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>
                           If you don't have any of these tools on your system, you can still use nm
                           to create a def file and edit it by hand through an editor.  For example:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
   nm file.dll &gt; dll.fil
   find " T _" dll.fil &gt; dll.def
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                           Replace the line at the top of dll.def that was created by the find program
                           and shows a file name with a line that says EXPORTS.  Set your editor to search for 
                           <code>T _</code> and erase it and anything on the line before it, leaving
                           only the routine names in the file.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        If the previous options don't work, you can still try to create a def file
                        using the output from the objdump program (from the MinGW distribution).
                        Here's an example.
                        <pre> 
   objdump -p file.dll &gt; dll.fil
                        </pre>
                        Search for <code>[Ordinal/Name Pointer] Table</code> in dll.fil and use the list 
                        of functions following it to create your def file.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
