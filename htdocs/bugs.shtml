<h1>MinGW - Reporting Bugs</h1>
<p>
                    So you think you have found a bug and want to
                    report the problem? Before reporting a bug
                    please ensure you have applied all applicable
                    updates to your build environment. Also please
                    search the MinGW archives to ensure the bug has
                    not already been reported or if a temporary
                    work around has been generated.&nbsp; When
                    reporting a bug to the MinGW mailing list
                    please include the following information:<br>

                    Bugs</span><br>
                    <br>
                     Under certain circumstances you may find a bug
                    in a base package, such as gcc, that is
                    platform independent (ie/ can be reproduced on
                    another platform other than Win32).&nbsp; In
                    this situation please generate a simple test
                    case that illustrates the bug using only
                    standard headers and libraries.&nbsp; Please
                    submit the bug following the procedure detailed
                    above <span class="underline">prior</span> to
                    submiting it to the primary maintainers. After
                    receiving verification from a MinGW developer
                    that the bug is indeed platform independent,
                    please use the appropriate bug tracker or
                    mailing list to inform the package
                    maintainers.&nbsp; It is in everyones best
                    interest that you try and use the package
                    maintainers standard methods and procedures for
                    bug submission.&nbsp; Avoid submiting bugs
                    specific to a port or application that is not a
                    part of the primary package to any list except
                    the MinGW users list.&nbsp; If you are
                    uncertain about bug submission to another
                    package maintainer seek assistance on the MinGW
                    users list.<br>
