                      MinGW and MSYS Distributions
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Development of MinGW is done within a
                      framework of inter-related <i>packages</i>.
                      There is a package for the MinGW runtime,
                      packages for GCC and other tool ports, a
                      package for the w32api, and so forth. All of
                      these packages conform to a set of common
                      conventions (internal layout, directory
                      structure, naming scheme). The traditional
                      method for installing MinGW was to create a
                      directory for the installation, download the
                      desired individual packages, and extract
                      their contents into the installation
                      directory (the common internal layout shared
                      by the packages made this possible).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, in mid-2001 the team began
                      publishing a single-archive "MinGW
                      distribution"... bundling the latest versions
                      of key individual packages available at the
                      time of release. This was done partially to
                      streamline the installation process for
                      newbies, and partially to help application
                      and library developers design products that
                      will build using MinGW (previously MinGW was
                      a moving target with all the constant updates
                      to individual packages, but now it is easier
                      to verify things as being "MinGW 1.0
                      compatible").
                    </p>
		    <p>
		      Early in 2002 the MinGW team delivered a package
		      they had dubbed MSYS.  This is a Minimal SYStem
		      providing a self hosted mingw32 target POSIX style
		      environment.  The updates to this package and it's
		      utilities are more controlled as the entire package
		      (which uses subsets of many smaller packages) is 
		      considered to be one package.  This package is also
		      delivered in a Win32 style setup installation binary
		      for better control of the installation.
		    </p>
                    <p>
                      The individual packages making up the MinGW
                      distribution are still produced and made
                      available for download separately. Updated
                      versions of individual packages will
                      sometimes be made available in between
                      releases of the main MinGW distribution... in
                      most cases it should be possible to extract a
                      package's content into your MinGW directory
                      to take advantage of the updates immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      MinGW packages available for download are hosted by
		      <a target="_nw" href="http://www.sf.net/">SourceForge</a>.
		      SourceForge provides each project with a 
		      <a target="_nw" href=
		      "http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435">
		      File Release System</a> 
		      for us to upload our releases to.  This system
		      is adequate for describing the singular package
		      distribution but provides challenges for the project that
		      provides an all-in-one type of package with updates
		      distributed individually.  We have therefore provided
		      for a dynamically updated release page of our own.  We
		      use the FRS provided by SourceForge to load the files
		      to one of five categories, Candidate, Current, Previous,
		      Proposed and Snapshot.  These categories are given at
		      the FRS package level.  The FRS release name is used to
		      give the package name and the files themselves are what
		      identify the release.  The script that creates the data
		      below is currently being perfected.  You may see the
		      below layout change as we perfect it.  However, we
		      suggest that you visit this page often for the status
		      of updates.

                    </h2>
		    <p>
		      Each package is the responsibility of the individual
		      developer.  It is the developer to decide what archive,
		      compression and distribution methods to use.  You will
		      see any combination of file extentions, .tar.gz,
		      .tar.bz2, .zip, .exe, etc.  Typically we use a file
		      naming convention of 
		      &lt;package&gt;-&lt;version&gt;-&lt;timestamp&gt;-&lt;fileversion&gt;.&lt;filetype&gt;.
		      This is not strictly adhered to but timestamp is always
		      in some form of YYYYMMDD format.  The fileversion if
		      given represents the number of occurrences a file with the
		      same name otherwise has been uploaded.  For example,
		      a developer uploads foo-1.0-20030601-1.tar.gz and then
		      later that day realizes he forgot something important, so
		      he then uploads foo-1.0-20030601-2.tar.gz to correct the
		      mistake.  The timestamp is optional on the Current release
		      but is a must for anything else.
