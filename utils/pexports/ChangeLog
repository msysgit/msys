	* hparse.y: types and parameters are now recognized as
	a series of tokens, which means that keywords like const
	struct and so on are not recognized as such, allowing any
	kind of parameter, including function pointers.

	new flag inc_flag is set
	* hparse.y: Added function_pointer and function_pointer_name rules
	* hparse.y: Function attributes are now handled as list of ID's
	* pexports.h: Incremented VER_MINOR
	* pexports.c: Print name of file if a header is not found
	* pexports.c: Separated printing to function dump_symbol
	* pexports.c: Fixed handling of forwarded exports

	* New files: str_tree.c str_tree.h: implements
	a symbol tree.
	* pexports.c: changed symbol handling to use str_tree,
	add_function_prot removed.
	* pexports.h: removed add_function_prot prototype
	* hlex.l: removed unnecessary code (count, CONSTANT, STRING)
	* hlex.l: added ATTRIBUTE token.
	* hparse.y: completely rewritten. *Much* improved parser.
	* pexports.h: changed VER_MINOR to 3

	* pexports.c: removed include_path structure and replaced
	it with a generic string list str_list.
	* pexports.c: preprocessor now defaults to "gcc -E -xc-header"
	instead of "cpp".
	* pexports.h: incremented minor version VER_MINOR to 2
	* pexports.c: headers are now parsed after all paramaters
	command line options have been parsed.
	* hparse.y: fixed problem with unnamed parameters that
