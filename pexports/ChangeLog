	* README: Update.
	* Makefile: Rewrite dist rule to create a .tar.lzma instead

	Package 0.44-1-mingw32 fixes.
	* pexports.c (main): Fix typo in usage statement.

	* hlex.l
	* hparse.y
	* pexports.h
	* pexports.c
	* str_tree.h
	* str_tree.c: Handle also 64-bit executables. Make it work also if
	built as 64-bit code. Remove all gcc -Wall warnings. Make it
	compilable also with MSVC. Disable Wow64 file system redirection
	when running as a 32-bit process on 64-bit Windows. Bump version
	to 0.44.

1999-04-02  Paul Sokolovsky  <Paul.Sokolovsky@technologist.com>

	* pexports.c: now distinguishes data/non-data symbols,
	depending on type of section symbol in

	* pexports.c: file offsets are now in hex

1998-11-07  Anders Norlander  <kv98anr@cs.umu.se>

	* hparse.y: types and parameters are now recognized as
	a series of tokens, which means that keywords like const
	struct and so on are not recognized as such, allowing any
	kind of parameter, including function pointers.

1998-11-05  Anders Norlander  <kv98anr@cs.umu.se>

	* hlex.l: removed all tokens except ID, CONST and VOLATILE
	* hparse.y: Added INC_ARGS macro to increment arg_size only if
	new flag inc_flag is set
	* hparse.y: Added function_pointer and function_pointer_name rules
	* hparse.y: Function attributes are now handled as list of ID's
	* pexports.h: Incremented VER_MINOR
	* pexports.c: Print name of file if a header is not found
	* pexports.c: Separated printing to function dump_symbol
	* pexports.c: Fixed handling of forwarded exports

1998-10-26  Anders Norlander  <anorland@hem2.passagen.se>

	* New files: str_tree.c str_tree.h: implements
	a symbol tree.
	* pexports.c: changed symbol handling to use str_tree,
	add_function_prot removed.
	* pexports.h: removed add_function_prot prototype
	* hlex.l: removed unnecessary code (count, CONSTANT, STRING)
	* hlex.l: added ATTRIBUTE token.
	* hparse.y: completely rewritten. *Much* improved parser.
	* pexports.h: changed VER_MINOR to 3

1998-10-21  Anders Norlander  <anorland@hem2.passagen.se>

	* pexports.c: removed include_path structure and replaced
	it with a generic string list str_list.
	* pexports.c: preprocessor now defaults to "gcc -E -xc-header"
	instead of "cpp".
	* pexports.h: incremented minor version VER_MINOR to 2
	* pexports.c: headers are now parsed after all paramaters
	command line options have been parsed.
	* hparse.y: fixed problem with unnamed parameters that
	are pointers.
	* pexports.c: in dump_exports: don't print extra white
	space if ordinals are not supposed to be printed.
